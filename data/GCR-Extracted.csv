However, recent research has suggested that two or more of the intrusions may not be of ring dyke form. The Hypersthene-gabbro is a complex and unusual intrusion with well-documented gravity layering and cumulus textures deformed by pseudo-sedimentary slump structures and now appears to have originally had a boss-like form. The Granophyric Quartz-dolerite of Sgurr-nam Meann is a very complex mass which has been the subject of intensive research over many years although the details of its form and origin still remain to be resolved. Both of these intrusions show features unique in the Tertiary Igneous Province of Britain.

In more recent years the postulated steep outward dip of the contacts has been widely challenged by an alternative view that the contacts dip gently inwards to produce a saucer or funnel-shaped intrusion. The problem at present has not been resolved although geophysical investigations have revealed that the maximum positive gravity anomaly found over Ardnamurchan is located over Centre 2 and not Centre 3. While this is admittedly inconclusive, it can hardly be said to support the hypothesis that Centre 3 consists of a nested complex of ring dykes some 3 kilometres in radius, each ring dyke having been formed by the subsidence of a central block of pre- existing, relatively dense igneous rock.

The intrusion appears to have been emplaced at a more or less constant level, at, or just below, the approximately planar erosion surface on which the Tertiary lavas were extruded; the frequent transgressions are necessary to maintain this level as the Jurassic rocks were folded into a gentle plunging syncline before the lavas were erupted and the sill was emplaced.

This structure brought the older rocks on top of the greywackes and mudstones where they formed an impervious ceiling which impounded the mineralising fluids in fissures below the fault. Exposures of mineralised veins are exceptionally poor, and the mineralogical interest resides mainly in the mine dumps. Over 60 mineral species have been identified making this the most prolific Scottish mineral locality. Primary sulphide ore minerals include galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and pyrite, but it is for the rare secondary minerals that the site is world-renowned.

It contains several distinct levels of abandoned passages in addition to major active streamways.  Ogof Draenen is unique among British cave systems in that it shows clear evidence of repeated flow-switching between risings in three separate valleys in response to their progressive incision into the karst aquifier.  The initial route was south-south-east into the Usk valley, followed by southwards into Cwm Afon, then north-north-westwards into Clydach Gorge, and finally south-south-east to the present main risings near the southern end of the Afon Lwyd valley.  More than 300 metres of incision has occurred since the highest passages were active conduits, suggesting a history of development extending into the early Pleistocene or even pre-Plesitocene.   The drainage history of the Ogof Draenen system also has considerable implications for our understanding of the Llangattock caves to the north, and the incision of the associated valleys provides an unparalleled opportunity for reconstructing the  evolution of the eastern South Wales landscape.

The pods are variable in character but the type examples, exhibiting a zoned association of talc, actinolites and biotite, occur in the well-exposed coastal sections of Ard Ghunel. Geochemical evidence indicates that these pods originated as ultra-basites which reacted with the more acid surrounding gneisses during regional metamorphism, producing this remarkable zonation. Ultrabasic lenses do occur within the foreland Lewisian gneisses but are largely unzoned. Intense reworking is, therefore, thought to be responsible for the formation of the Skye pods.

The latter are of controversial stratigraphical affinity but are generally assigned to the Moine. The Tarskavaig Nappe lies below the Moine Thrust and above the Kishorn Nappe; it is confined to the Sleat of Skye, although it may correspond to the Balmacara Nappe of the mainland. It is largely composed of a series of low-grade psammitic metasediments - the Tarskavaig Group - which progressively young away from the Lewisian mylonites developed at the base of the nappe, that is immediately adjacent to the Tarskavaig Thrust plane. The various lithologies of the Tarskavaig Group are well-displayed and can be directly compared with the underlying Torridonian strata. The Tarskavaig metasediments are somewhat intermediate in characer, lying between certain Torridonian lithologies and parts of the overlying Moine, so that there has been disagreement as to which group these rocks should be assigned. Much of the vital information necessary for an appraisal of the stratigraphical affinities of this controversial group of metasediments is located within this site.

Lewisian basement occurs in two distinct structural positions within the Moine succession. In the Morar fold, Lewisian lithologies occupy what are considered to be early isoclinal fold cores which are themselves folded around the later antiform, whereas on the eastern flank of the fold, Lewisian rocks, in a structurally higher position, form part of a complex early fold - the Ardnamurrach Isocline. To the east of the Ardnamurrach Isocline, rocks, whose lithology is characteristic of the Glenfinnan Division, tongues out on Sgurr Breac.

The Basal Shell Bed is one of the best known fossil bearing rocks in the Jurassic, due to the classic monographic work of Cox, with more than ninety described species. The top of the section shows outstanding sections through the basal Purbeck Beds with some of the best exposures of the Dirt Beds available, in places containing trees in growth position. This is the only permanent locality in the British Jurassic to yield post-Kimmeridgian corals. A key site for studies in carbonate sedimentology and palaeontology exhibiting the final phases of Jurassic marine sedimentation, and transition from clastic to carbonate sedimentation in mid-Portlandian times and the final regressive phase with the onset of non-marine conditions in the Purbeck Beds.

Because the complex is partly intruded into limestone it has had an important place in the historical development of ideas on the genesis of strongly undersaturated rocks, and the origin of some of the ultrabasic rock types is still controversial. Because some intrusive units in the complex appear to have been emplaced after the main thrust movements on the Ben More Thrust Plane, while others were emplaced before or concurrently with the movements, isotopic dating of the Loch Borralan suite has provided a relatively exact age for part of the movements in the Moine Thrust belt.

Organic sedimentation began at about 13,200 BP, providing a minimum age for Late Devensian deglaciation of the area. Palynological evidence shows a deterioration of climate from about 12,120 BP, eventually culminating in the Loch Lomond Stadial; there is no evidence for a Bolling oscillation recorded at some other sites. The onset of the Loch Lomond Stadial is defined by an abrupt lithological change from organic lake muds to clay-rich minerogenic sediment at about 11,160 BP and is accompanied by a change from tree, shrub and warmth-loving herb pollen to that of open habitat herbs.

Conventially a tripartite division of till, sands and gravels and till has been recognised. The sediments were first interpreted as the product of marine submergence during the Biblical Flood. Later, the effects of glaciations were recognised in the till units, whilst a period of marine submergence was invoked to account for the intervening shelly sands and gravels. Subsequently, it was thought that the shelly deposits dated from an early advance of ice from the Irish Sea, surviving as high-level remnants of old drift cover.

The kettleholes are representative of many developed throughout the Wrexham area in the sands and gravels of the famous Wrexham Delta Terrace, and were probably formed towards the close of the Devensian glaciation by the melting of buried ice.

The sands, derived from glaciofluvial sediments, were deposited under aeolian, periglacial conditions during the Loch Lomond Stadial. The coversands have been dated to 13 240–10 220 years BP by luminescence dating and are analogous to theYounger Coversand II in Europe. Layers of organic-rich sediment interbedded with the sands indicate periods of stability during deposition and give an indication of the vegetation from the pollen. The sands became stabilized during the early Holocene, but subsequent possible re-activation occurred locally later in the Holocene after the elm decline as a result of forest clearance. These Mere Sands have been also interpreted as lacustrine sands and have greater affinity with modern beach and dune sands. Mere Sands Wood is a critical reference site for studies of the Shirdley Hill Formation and provides important evidence for interpreting geomorphological processes and environmental changes during the Devensian Late-glacial and Holocene in north-west England.

The site shows the value of absolute pollen diagrams in establishing pollen zonation when percentage pollen analysis had failed to do this. During the early Holocene, the rate of sedimentation was sufficiently rapid to allow the accumulation of a thick deposit, enabling important radiocarbon dating of changes in forest composition to be made, including the Elm Decline and changes associated with the Neolithic stone-axe factories in Langdale.

Dimlington is important on several accounts. Firstly, organic remains in the Dimlington Silts have yielded radiocarbon dates of 18 500 ± 400 years BP and 18 240 ± 240 years BP, and provide not only a record of palaeoenvironmental conditions but also a limiting date for the maximum expansion of Late Devensian ice.

It contains a wide range of landform features associated with past periglacial climates and has also served as a field laboratory for the testing of a number of early studies on slope evolution and slope-forming processes. Some of the first attempts to provide an accurate method of mapping the morphology of slopes were also carried out in this valley and adjacent areas. The valley also contains a number of well-known tors which were used by D.L. Linton to illustrate his classic theory of tor formation. Additional geomorphological highlights of the site including escarpments, structural benches, solifluction deposits, weathering features, blockfields, blockslopes, a variety of slope-forms and a Devensian late-glacial soil. This variety of landforms and deposits provides an exceptionally compact and comprehensive assemblage of geomorphological features that are representative of old upland areas with a long and complex evolution, including prolonged exposure to periglacial rather than glacial processes during the Quaternary.

However, the present features probably reflect a long and complex evolution under the successive glacial, periglacial and interglacial morphogenic environments of the Pleistocene. At present the tors are slowly weathering through the effects of frost action, tree-root penetration and soil humic acids.

Both Pendine-Laugharne and Whiteford Beaches form spits trending away from a predominantly rocky, cliffed coastline. The former is dominated by a narrow line of dunes which reach more than 15m in height. As the beach extended eastwards from Ragwen Point former rock cliffs were protected from marine erosion. Whitford Burrows has shown general progradation apart from its proximal end and is linked at low water to Broughton Bay where dunes rest on rock cliffs and reach altitudes in excess of 50m above sea-level. Some of the sand reaching these dunes at present is probably blown from Rhosili Bay which is influenced by the rocky headlands of Burry Holmes and Worms Head The beach is backed over much of its length by till cliffs and locally by dunes. Both of the latter are affected by erosion and Rhosili beach appears to be in deficit, lacking a significant sediment supply from either offshore or alongshore. Tywyn-Pembrey is a barrier beach linked to the mainland by former dunes and reclaimed marshland and is one of only four large barrier systems in England and Wales. It is strongly related to Atlantic wave systems and has been little modified by engineering structures. Seaward of the main zone of grey dunes in Tywyn Burrows there is a zone of low sandy hummocks fringed by a narrow ridge of younger, active dunes extending into both Gwendraeth and Burry estuaries. This is a fine example of a progradational beach to which the supply of sediment is sufficient not only to allow growth of the beach in general but also to maintain sufficient longshore drift to continue the lateral growth of two spits.

The pit is located immediately to the south of a fossil shoreline, a buried Chalk cliff forming the northern boundary of the site. Banked against this cliff is an extremely complex sequence of littoral, colluvial, landslip, ?fluvial and intertidal deposits, containing evidence of a number of different climatic intervals. Most importantly, the finer-grained intertidal sediments, where they are deeply buried and thus not decalcified, contain an extensive interglacial small mammal fauna, while large mammals, other vertebrates, molluscs and pollen also occur. Palaeolithic artefacts of a well-developed Acheulian culture, are found throughout the sequence, but their most important occurrence is on an occupation horizon at the top of the intertidal sediments, where they appear to be in primary context. Work is continuing on the interpretation of this site and the dating of the sedimetns, but present indications are that the mammalian fauna points to a pre-Hoxnian interglacial age, rather than the Hoxnian, which has normally been associated with the raised shoreline in this area. The fauna is comparable to that from the important cave site at Westbury-sub-Mendip, which is widely regarded as being of Cromerian age. There is some confirmation of an early date from the molluscs which include a gastropod species previously believed to have become extinct by the early Pleistocene. The combination of a probable early-Middle Pleistocene age and a well-developed Acheulian culture has major implications for Pleistocene and Palaeolithic chronology in Britain and in Western Europe, as previously such industries have always been considered to be post-Anglian.

Downstream, with progressive widening of the area available for channel migration, the Allt Mor becomes a steep mountain torrent with a bed of coarse boulders. With the gradual lowering of channel slope and a considerable widening of the floodplain, there is an area of extensive deposition where older more stable bars are intermixed with areas of more recent activity. Secondly, the site is also important for the extreme contrast between the fine-grained, low slope, sinuous bed of the River Nairn and the steep, coarse-grained bed of the Allt Mor.

Rocks of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group are overlain by the Coniston Limestone Formation of the Ashgill Series, overlain in turn by a Silurian sequence comprised of Skelgill Beds, Browgill Beds and Brathay Flags. The geological structure of this area is complex, however, and of considerable interest in studies of the structure of this region. The rocks are cut by a series of fault dislocations, predominantly of wrench type, oriented north-west to south-east and mostly of dextral displacement. An unusual feature of the faults is the apparent termination of the great majority at or close to the Ordovician/Silurian boundary. However, detailed study has shown that these faults do not terminate but rather turn into parallelism with the bedding, and change their nature from wrench faults to thrusts. The explanation of this unusual feature lies in the presence of a soft shale formation, the Skelgill Shales, which have acted as a focus for the distortion and displacement generated by stresses imposed during the Caledonian mountain building episode (orogeny). This shale layer has thus absorbed many of the wrench faults which displace the volcanic rocks and the Coniston Limestone Group. Thrusts within the Skelgill Shales also truncate some of the upper mudstone formations within the Coniston Limestone Group and result in a variable width of outcrop for the Skelgill Shales. This structural style can be recognised within the Skelgill Shales for the whole 25 mile length of its outcrop across the Lake District. Furthermore, a number of major faults of regional significance, such as the Coniston and Brathay Faults, are terminated at this shale layer by conversion into bedding thrusts in a way described above.

The understanding of the nature of this junction is of great importance in unravelling the complex structural evolution of the region and particularly in dating the main phases of folding and cleavage formation. A number of small outcrops in Scarbrow Wood demonstrate both slates of the Skiddaw Group and overlying tuffs of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group as well as the junction of the two groups.

The head deposits contain a fauna indicative of a late-glacial age and demonstrate an open-ground, periglacial-type of environment. Land snails from the overlying tufa indicate a range of environmental conditions, varying from marsh and open woodland to closed woodland, and record detailed changes marking the Boreal/Atlantic transition. Land clearance, probably during the Iron Age, is indicated by the fauna in the hillwash deposits.

There is still disagreement but there is no doubt that the sequences are caused by terrestrial glacial readvances. The upper part of the succession is also significant in providing lithostratigraphical and biostratigraphical evidence for late-glacial environmental conditions.

The orientation of this channel and the composition of the gravel pose a number of important questions for Pleistocene stratigraphy in this area. The gravel contains numerous semi-durable igneous clasts, suggesting a glacial, ice-proximal origin, whereas the orientation of the channel, from the north-west to the south-east, suggests a possible connection with the pre-glacial fluvial system, perhaps an Upper Severn-Thames drainage routeway.

The gravel at this site contains more Jurassic material than is typical, suggesting the involvement of a tributary to the main Baginton Gravel river. The upper deposit at Snitterfield is exceptional. It comprises strongly laminated (possibly varved) clay and silt, passing upwards into structureless clay near the modern land surface (perhaps disturbed by soil processes). This laminated deposit would conventionally be attributed to deposition in Glacial Lake Harrison, which is thought to have covered a large part of the Midlands during the Wolstonian glacial period. Adjacent sections at Snitterfield were of major importance in the original descriptions of Lake Harrison, while the present site provides probably the best exposures of these glaciolacustrine deposits ever to have existed.

In the 1960s, interglacial remains were recorded here and a Hoxnian age suggested. More recent exposures have revealed organic sediments from much older periods, interbedded with the Kesgrave deposits. The oldest of these is of interglacial origin and contains wood and other plant remains as well as pollen. The latter indicates an early Middle Pleistocene age, perhaps within the Cromer Complex of interglacials recognised in the Netherlands, but probably earlier than the Cromerian sensu stricto of the British type site. The only other British locality where interglacial deposits similar to those at Ardleigh have been recorded is Broomfield, near Chelmsford, unfortunately no longer available for study. Higher in the sequence at Ardleigh a further horizon rich in pollen and plant remains occurs, but this time of cold climate (arctic) affinities. This horizon contains important plant macrofossils rare or unique in Britain. A fossil rubified soil has also been identified at the top of the fluvial sequence at Ardleigh, believed to represent the Valley Farm Soil of Suffolk. Currently work is progressing with the aim of correlating the Kesgrave gravels of southern East Anglia with deposits in the modern Middle Thames valley.

The two most southern sections show Avon Terrace 4 gravels overlying Baginton Gravel. The latter forms part of the Wolstonian (penultimate glacial stage) sequence recognised in this part of the Midlands, the type site being nearby at Wolston. It is a fluvial gravel attributed, on the basis of palaeocurrent data, to a north-eastward flowing river. These deposits reach the land surface in the northern part of the area and the section north of Brandon Lane appears only to show Baginton Gravel. This northermost section is of considerable importance, however, in that organic beds of interglacial or interstadial origin are present within the Baginton Gravel here. Investigation of these has only just started, but will hopefully provide important information about the age of this fluvial sequence. Pollen and plant macrofossils are present in abundance and present excellent potential for relative dating and correlation of the Baginton Gravel with the established British Pleistocene chronology, something which has yet to be carried out satisfactorily. Over much of this area the Baginton Gravel is overlain by the later Avon Terrace 4 gravels, which have palaeocurrents to the west and a conspicuous flint component (absent in the Baginton Gravel). In both the southern two sections the Baginton Gravel and the terrace deposits are locally separated by further gravels, deeply channelled into the former. These contain flint, but considerably less than the Terrace 4 gravel. They have been interpreted as equivalent to Avon Terrace 3, which some workers have considered earlier than Terrace 4. This interpretation requires a most unusual sequence of events to have occurred, reversing the conventional order of these Avon terraces. Research is currently being carried out which may determine whether this reversal has occurred. An alternative interpretation of the channel gravels at Brandon and Ryton, based on a more conventional terrace stratigraphy, is that they merely represent earlier sedimentation within the period of aggradation represented by Terrace 4.

The dyke is about three metres wide, with a closely-spaced horizontal jointing which helps distinguish it from the more massively jointed lavas. The dyke has long been noted for the presence of large (up to 5cm) clear crystals of sanidine feldspar, which show euhedral outlines and Carlsbad twinning.

East of Erraid Sound, large enclaves of diorite are present and form the disrupted remains of a substantial diorite body, the intrusion of which seems to have overlapped the earlier stages of granite emplacement. On Eilean a'Chalmain a variety of diorite and tonalite pulses, some of which are seen only as xenoliths, document the dioritic stage in the history of the complex. It is considered that distinct dioritic and granitic magmas have contributed to the evolution of the complex but the frequent presence of hybrid granodiorite points to either the contamination of the granite magma by dioritic material or to a degree of magma mixing. Of interest also is a late, sub-vertical dyke of hybrid microganite which cuts the main Ross of Mull granite near Cnoc an t-Suidhe.",,"EO,EC",

The intrusive sequence began with early basic to ultrabasic rocks, which show some deformation, intrusion by granite and pegmatite, and local magmatism. These rocks are crosscut by basic to intermediate dykes, then later granites and pegmatites and, finally, dolerites from the pre-Scourie dyke pegmatites at Leanish point.

It includes outcrops from which samples were collected and isotopically dated in the pioneering studies of geochronology. Acid, basic and ultrabasic gneisses can be seen, containing mineral assemblages typical of the pyroxene granulite facies. Basic gneisses are cut by acid veins which often originate as offshoots from the acid gneiss. Thus it is one of the few places where clean exposure allows age relationships between gneisses of different composition to be established. Both acid and basic gneisses are cut by a second generation of acid veins, consisting of microperthite and quartz. The feldspar from these veins has yielded Rb/Sr ages of 2,500my. These acid veins are cut by the dolerites of the later Scourie dyke suite. Four distinctive types of basic dyke belonging to this suite may be found at this site, and all the dykes are discordant to the gneissic banding. The most prominent dykes are NW-SE trending, about 20 metres wide, of gabbroic grain size and have sub-ophitic textures. These dykes branch in several places. Close to these dolerites are a small number of thin ultrabasic veins, containing small olivine phenocrysts, these are similar to the ultrabasic dykes of Assynt. The third representative dyke type is a narrow E-W trending dark green amphilobite which has an undersaturated olivine basalt composition. Hypersthene dolerites with accessory quartz and microperthite make up the fourth dyke type. One of these is crosscut by a prominent NW-SE gabbro dyke. In some places the dyke contacts are undeformed, in others they have been deformed in narrow shear zones. Both dykes and shear zones are cut by pegmatites containing microcline, plagioclase, quartz and muscovite, the feldspar and muscovite from which have yielded Rb/Sr ages of 1,500-1,600my.

The eastern or St David's section, higher up the hill, is in a dangerous condition, but of considerable interest in showing the intimate structural association with greenstone and the strong shearing accompanying vein emplacement. Overall, the mine illustrates the preference of the mineralisation for sapropelitic horizons, resulting in large amounts of pyrite and pyrrhotite. While the mineralisation is similar to the Vigra Mine (qv) there is less cobaltite and here the gold-telluride association reaches maximum development. In the western part of the mine, bismuth, lead and silver tellurides are present, while in the eastern St David's Section, bismuth sulphides have been recently reported.

Three vein systems outcrop on the west bank of the Mawddach and a fourth (the Cwm Heisian Isaf Lode) on the east bank. All four are closely associated with greenstone. Galena and sphalerite are the most abundant ore minerals but pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, freibergite, pyargyrite, polybasite, gold and electrum also occur. The electrum and gold occur as inclusions in pyrite, or associated with other silver minerals, which, with late galena, are seen to often replace sphalerite. The mine was worked originally for lead and silver. Gold was located in cross fractures and the richest gold ore is associated with marginal shears to greenstone intrusions. The Cwm Heisen Isaf Lode fracture is exposed in the bed of the Mawddach on both banks but on the east bank it displays an excellent example of small-scale crustification banding. The bands are of calcite and sulphide (dominantly sphalerite) but later growths of marcasite cross the banding and rosettes of marcasite have grown on the sphalerite bands.

The mine is at the intersection of several veins in the Cambrian Vigra Flags, but vein development is limited by orientation perpendicular to the strike. The upper levels, in forestry grounds, are accessible and associated with dumps which are of interest in containing cobaltite and its alteration product, erythrite. More extensive dumps associated with the now collapsed lowest level, are less interesting mineralogically, as they are derived from below the zone of supergene enrichment. However, one small area of sorted material is present. The mineral assemblage (Clogau type) is typical of the south-western end of the Dolgellau Gold belt in containing early arsenopyrite and cobaltite followed by the normal sulphide assemblage (pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite) and late galena, gold and tellurides.

In dumps adjacent to the main road, specimens of similar morphology to those at the world type locality (Blagill Mine qv) are abundant and the same paragenetic sequence can be established in relation to witherite. However, secondary barite has developed from both witherite and barytocalcite and its association with aurichalcite and hemimorphite confirms that it probably formed in the oxidation zone, as a result of the action of sulphate-rich water on carbonates.

The ribbon gneiss, blastomylonite and phyllinite seen in the gneisses at Portsoy and Dinnet House, in Deeside, are not seen in the Inzie Head gneisses.

This is an extremely important site with regard to the orogenic evolution of the Dalradian. The structural and stratigraphical significance of these gneisses cannot be overestimated, especially as they have yielded Precambrian dates similar to those of the Cadomian province.

At Holland two gravels are exposed, the site representing the type locality of both. The Lower Holland Gravel is recognised as the final terrace aggradation by the Thames before its diversion, here including a small but significant contribution from the contemporary River Medway, which has been traced across eastern Essex to its confluence with the Thames in this area. The overlying Upper Holland Gravel has a very different composition, indicating that it is largely a Medway deposit, although with a proportion of glacial outwash material. A gravel of this type could only have been deposited while the Thames was blocked by ice and not reaching this lower part of its valley, since the eventual diversion of the Thames rerouted it via London and the old Medway valley to the Clacton area, truncating the Medway in the area of the modern Thames estuary. The events represented in the Holland section are of great significance in the reconstruction of the Pleistocene history of the Thames.

The importance of this fauna lies in the use which has been made of it in establishing Pleistocene terrace stratigraphy in the Avon Basin. The deposits at Ailstone underlie the 4th Terrace of the Stour, but have been considered to represent the same interglacial as shelly sediments underlying the lower (3rd) Terrace elsewhere in the Avon Basin. This view places both these terraces in the Ipswichian (last) Interglacial. This is despite a number of differences in the faunal assemblages between the lower Terrace 3 sites and that at Ailstone. The latter site is the only one in the 4th Terrace from which unequivocal interglacial mollusca have been obtained. Current research on the Avon terraces is seriously challenging the established chronology, which requires that the Terrace 4 deposits are strigraphically younger than those of Terrace 3, the reverse of what normal terrace development would have produced. The recently developed technique of amino-stratigraphy, which enables the relative dating of molluscan shells on the basis of the progressive decay of their contained amino-acids, will hopefully provide sound evidence to confirm or refute the established stratigraphy. If the Ailstone mollusca are found to be older than the Ipswichian Interglacial, they will almost certainly represent a new, as yet undefined, warm period. Evidence that such a period may have existed is accumulating from elsewhere in Britain, but Ailstone may be the first site in the Midlands at which it can be identified. Whatever the outcome, the Ailstone site is of critical importance for the understanding of the Avon terrace sequence, since it is the only site yielding warm climate mollusca from the 4th Terrace.",Quaternary,Finite buried,AILSTONE OLD GRAVEL PIT

These outcrops provide an excellent illustration of the characteristic features of the small and medium scale structures associated with the major syncline. Amongst the features displayed are nine folds with numerous associated structures such as cleavage (closely spaced parallel fractures), complementary faulting and accommodation structures.

They expose a clear angular unconformity of Wenlock on Precambrian rocks, important in constraining the regional tectonic history. The quarries lie within the Old Radnor Inlier, a small fault-bounded and dissected sliver along the south-west continuation of the Church Stretton Fault. The inlier comprises Precambrian sedimentary rocks unconformably overlain by Lower Wenlock limestones. Wenlock age shales surround the inlier, mainly with faulted contacts, but in places possibly with depositional contacts. The main structural features of the locality are numerous steep faults, mostly cutting both Precambrian and Wenlock rocks. The quarries provide good sections through the Church Stretton Fault Zone, in an area of otherwise poor exposure.

The two upper formations of the Old Red Sandstone, the Porth y mor Formation and the Traeth Lligwy Formation, lie in a broad synclinal structure. This open structure has a monoclinal fold on its northern limb, while on the southern limb thrusting and tight minor folds with axial planar cleavage occur.

Especially significant are the birds-eye tuffs, containing accretionary lapilli (fragments of lava erupted from a volcanic centre and probably falling into standing bodies of water). The lapilli are thought to have been originally spherical but are now distorted into ellipsoidal shapes as a result of intense compressive stress imposed during the Caledonian mountain building episode (orogeny). The degree of flattening of the lapilli gives a very useful indication of the extent and nature of the distortion suffered by the rocks during the orogeny. Other notable features of the tuffs are the powerfully developed cleavage (closely spaced parallel fractures) and well-defined orientation of the elongate lapilli, forming a prominent linear structure. The intense cleavage developed here is recognised in a belt of rocks running from Kentmere to Wrengill and has been interpreted as resulting from contact strain where tuff beds occur between massive lava flows.

Some 2 m of weathered sandstone or grus are exposed and this and similar material elsewhere in the Pennines has been the focus of much enquiry and speculation concerning its mode of formation and morphogenic implications. The grus has been variously explained as the product of intensive chemical weathering during the Tertiary, Late Devensian periglacial weathering and weathering by humic acids during the Holocene. Recent detailed studies at Blackstone Edge have shown that the grus there is a produce of in situ weathering in two distinct phases. Initially the rock was chemically weathered, not intensively under tropical conditions, but more probably under interglacial or interstadial climates. Later mechanical weathering has been attributed to Late Devensian frost related processes. As one of the best exposures of grus available in northern England, Blackstone Edge is an important reference site for this type of material, the origins of which have a significant bearing on the history of Pleistocene weathering, landscape evolution and tor formation.

The New Inn section has yielded a rich molluscan fauna as well as mammalian bones and teeth and is a key site for dating this terrace. This section is of particular stratigraphic importance because in the Cropthorne area an unusual interpretation of the terrace stratigraphy of the River Avon was established. This claimed that terraces 3 and 4 represented the same aggradation, from the base of 3 to the top of 4, and that the terrace surfaces resulted from subsequent erosion. Both terraces are well-developed at Cropthorne. Much of the Pleistocene stratigraphic framework for Midland England hinges upon this interpretation. Recent work suggests that Terrace 3 results from later dissection of Terrace 4 and that deposits of different ages are represented, as in conventional terrace stratigraphy.

The two sequences are separated by a persistent clay seam and the lower is crowded with upstanding Lycopodites (1m) in life-position. The quarry and road cutting sediments are postulated as having been deposited within a yet larger through-channel traversing the Lower Tunbridge Wells braidplain, of which the quarry at Robingate Wood may expose the normal succession. The three sequences are to be contrasted with those at the Hastings- Pett Level sites, which formed in a more coastal meanderplain.

The fluviatile Ardingly sandstones lie on a ferruginous intraformational conglomerate, containing debris from a lateritic soil. They presently show very low-angle, large-scale trough cross- bedding facing south-south-east, as at Hook 1km to the south. During the next decade, when quarrying returns down the west side of the pit, the heads of large gravelly scoops will be transected again. Water flow down the delta-fan slope was intermittent, varying from powerful (horizonal laminae with current lineation) to weak (ripple cross- lamination) to nil (wave ripples, often draped with trailed and burrowed or sometimes suncracked clay films). Molluscan body fossils (Neomiodon, Viviparus, Unio) record freshwater conditions. The bottom 1m, directly above the intraformational conglomerate, contains abundant upstanding Lycopodites in life positions, associated with small structures showing that the plants grew upwards as the sand accreted around them. Dinosaur bones are frequent in this sandstone, and a headless articulated skeleton of Iguanodon has been found. Other reptiles and fish (including whole Pachythrissops) have also turned up. The sequence shows a depositional dip of a few degrees to the south, and may be, with that at Hook, part of a village-sized fan. The graded Top Lower Tunbridge Wells Pebble Bed cuts horizontally and erosively across the Ardingly sandstones. It is a rich repository of Precambrian, Lower and Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic debris from the London Massif. Visean and Portlandian cherts, phosphatised Kimmeridgian ammonites and Portlandian glauconite can be collected, but Armorican debris is virtually absent. Above, the quarry overburden comprises more than 8m of dark lower Grinstead clays, recording salinities ranging more widely, from freshwater (Equisetum lyellii in life position, Cypridea, Unio, Viviparus, etc) to appreciably brackish (dinoflagellates, non-Cypridea ostracods, Neomiodon yielding C-isotope evidence). Waterflow varied from stagnant (finely laminated dark clays with unorientated plant fragments, ostracods, etc) to weak (clays with orientated debris) to briefly strong (siltstone gutter casts). A suncracked and partly oxidised sideritic ironstone records a period of exposure. Fine plant debris is common and disarticulated dinosaur bones are occasionally found near the base. With the underlying Pebble Bed, the lowest Grinstead Member records the inundation of the Ardingly fan-delta by a shallow lagoon, bay or lake of varying salinity, itself invaded by the Cuckfield Member sand body. The transition to the latter is shown by lenticular bedding at the top of the overburden face. With the Hook site, this is probably the most important inland exposure of the Hastings Beds Group generally, being a vital key to the provenance of their materials, their conditions of deposition and their plant and animal ecology. The scientific potential of this site is enhanced by the cliffs (up to 10m high) in nearby Chiddingly Wood.

The succession ranges from the Crinan Grits and Tayvallich Limestone, of the Argyll Group, through the Tayvallich Volcanics to the Kells Grit of the Southern Highland Group. A major fold, the (F1) Tayvallich Syncline, runs through the area and has an axial planar crenulation cleavage. This large area is best considered as a number of separate sections. 1. Loch na Cille. This area is in the axial zone of the Tayvallich   Syncline and contains the youngest rocks of the section, the   arkosic sandstones of the Kells Grit NR698806}. They are   distinct from the older Crinan Grits in containing detrital   epidote and more feldspar and mica.   The Loch na Cille Boulder Bed is the most remarkable unit in the   area. It stratigraphically overlies pillow lavas, exposed on the   west coast, and is in turn overlain by limestone containing   fragments of the metabasite that crops out on the east coast. The   boulder bed has a spilitic to calcareous matrix full of fragments   of metabasite and pebbles of acid volcanics. This controversial   deposit is now generally considered to be a hyaloclastite of   submarine volcanic origin, probably from a fissure eruption. 2. The north-west coast to An Aird. This section contains the   classic outcrops of the Tayvallich Lavas. Northwards along the   coast progressively older members of the lava formation occur.   The lithologies include massive lava, pillow lava, pillow   breccias, stratified and reworked hyaloclastites, porphyry breccia   containing large boulders of feldspar porphyry and a pink feldspar   porphyry intrusion. 3. Rubha na h-Airde to Port an Sgadain. The peninsula is composed of   a metabasite laccolith which may represent the magma chamber   feeding the pillow lavas. Northwards from Rubha na h-Airde the   pillow lavas are replaced by pillow breccias and hyaloclastites,   then thin rusty-weathering limestone lenses are seen until just   south of Port an Sgadain where a distinct dolomitic breccia   occurs. 4. Port an Sgadain to Port Bealach nan Gall. At the southern end of   this section the base of the Tayvallich Lava Formation and the   underlying Tayvallich Limestone occur. Here the lava flows have   pipe amygdales at the base and scoriaceous tops, often with rusty   limestone veins penetrating between the blocks of lava. Peach   used these exposures to demonstrate that the sequence here dips   uninverted to the south-south-east. During its extrusion the   lowermost lava produced push-folds in the underlying phyllite.   The Tayvallich Limestone is very variable comprising dolomites and   phyllites, thin-bedded and massive limestones, and conglomeratic   horizons. It contains a variety of sedimentary structures   including grading, cross-bedding, channelling and flute casts.   The limestone probably had a turbiditic origin.   At Port Bealach nan Gall the Crinan Grits are exposed beneath the   limestones. They are coarse-grained and locally conglomeratic   containing a pelitic bed with carbonate nodules above which are   excellent examples of flute casts. 5. The closure of the Tayvallich Syncline can be traced out by   following the junction between the limestone and the lavas around   the northern slopes of Barr na h-Iolaire. In spite of much of the   limestone being obscured by debris the base of the lavas can be   traced around the minor folds associated with the closure of the   syncline. Historically this large site is a classic area, being the location of the first recognition of pillow lavas in the Dalradian.

Playfair studied the geology of Schiehallion in more detail and was able to recalculate the earth's density more accurately. The importance of this area to Dalradian stratigraphy and tectonics was hinted at by work in the early part of the nineteenth century which correlated the Schichallion Boulder Bed with the Portaskaig Boulder Bed. This work was later confirmed by classic stratigraphic and structural studies in the early part of the twentieth century. In Strath Fionan, the boundary slide was formerly believed to separate the Moine Struan Flags from the Blair Atholl Series of the lower Dalradian. The Beoil Schist was interpreted as a tectonic schist formed during movement along the slide. However more recent work has shown that the Dalradian succession in this area is actually a complete stratigraphic sequence from the Struan Flags of the Grampian Group, through the entire Lochaber, Ballachulish and Blair Atholl Subgroups of the Dalradian Appin Group up to the Schichallion Boulder Bed at the base of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Although greatly compressed, and in places exhibiting features indicative of very high strain, this succession is considered to be the most complete sequence of the Appin Group yet described. The apparently unique feature of this area is that the entire Appin Group succession can be traced from the Grampian Group into the Argyll Group without a structural break or stratigraphic omission. Clearly this is a site of the highest historical and geological interest especially in light of the recent reinterpretation of the stratigraphy.

In addition, the structures in the Dalradian section are of far-reaching importance in interpreteing the major structure of the Highland Border Region. The fault zone is well-exposed (on the west bank) north of a narrow gorge in Old Red Sandstone volcanics. On the south of the fault Old Red Sandstone breccia and sandstone dip moderately southwards. Along the fault zone are strongly folded soft black slates (?Highland Border Series). North of the fault zone is a Dalradian succession of the uppermost Southern Highland Group, beginning with Upper Leny Grits overlain to the north by Leny Limestone and Shales and then by Upper Leny Grits. Work in the Callander area has shown that the Aberfoyle Slates occupy the core of a major downward-facing synform, flanked by the younger (Leny and Ben Ledi) grits. It has been concluded that the synform is a downward-facing structure, comparable with the downbent hinge of the Tay Nappe. Within this site there is abundant evidence (eg graded and current bedding) showing that the Dalradian succession is generally inverted. There are two distinct cleavages which can be detected within the grits of this site. There is an early slaty cleavage, at a very low angle to bedding, and a later fracture (or crenulation) cleavage which is apparently axial planar to the major downward-facing synform of the Callander area. In the Allt a' Chroin intermediate-scale WSW trending synforms have folded the slaty cleavage so that it faces downwards on the northen limbs and upwards on the southern limbs, whereas the later crenulation cleavage consistently faces down. In Allt Sron Eadar a'Chinn a strong slaty cleavage dipping north-west faces upwards across almost vertically dipping current-bedded silty sandstones which lie on the south-east limb of the major fold and young to the south-west. It has been suggested that these intermediate-scale folds are parasitic on the major downward-facing synform at Callander, however, the cleavage relationships within this site suggest the structure is secondary. Thus, it follows that the synform is a fold of a primary structure, probably the Tay Nappe, and that the structural and stratigraphic setting of the Callander area is in marked contrast to the Dunkeld area. This site is of first rate importance on two counts. Firstly it provides good exposure of the Highland Boundary Fault and the associated rocks. Secondly, structural and stratigraphic relationships within the site show that here the rocks occur in the limb of a secondary downward-facing synform which folds the primary Tay Nappe.",Precambrian,EW,

It was believed that the nappes were ‘squeezed out’ on both sides of a zone of steeply dipping rocks called the Geal-charn - Ossian Steep Belt, which is well exposed in the adjacent Aonach Beag and Geal-charn GCR site.  This in effect created a mushroom-shaped ‘fountain’ of nappes in which individual nappes were separated by ductile dislocations termed slides.  Away from the steep belt to the south-east the primary nappes became highly inclined and all of the structures were subsequently refolded by more-upright folds of at least two generations, resulting in the observed pattern of recumbent structures.
	The Ben Alder GCR site is situated on the south-east side of the steep belt, where it has been argued that the effects of superimposed F2 and F3 folds on originally highly inclined, SE-facing F1 folds can be demonstrated clearly in three-dimensional detail.  This structural architecture has been crucial to any interpretation of the development of the steep belt and of the nappes between Ben Alder and the Boundary Slide at Blair Atholl.  This in turn is fundamental to theories for the origin and evolution of the Grampian nappe complexes in general.  
	The most recent published work has emphasized the influence of the original depositional framework of the Grampian Group sediments, and in particlar the basin geometry, on the subsequent structural architecture.  Hence the Geal-charn - Ossian Steep Belt is no longer regarded as a simple root zone to the major nappes and has been attributed to compression of the sediments against a basement ‘high’ that forms the basin margin.  The ongoing debate will continue to draw heavily upon evidence from the Ben Alder area, emphasizing still further the national importance of the Aonach Beag to Geal-charn and Ben Alder GCR sites.",Precambrian,EO,Ben Alder and Aonach Beag

Outcrops at Ray Crag exposes effusive products of the early stages of development of the volcanic pile, and these are chiefly of basic composition. Excellent exposures of subaerial pahoehoe, aa and blocky basalt lavas are all present, probably to the best advantage of any locality in Britain. Outcrops in the vicinity of Stonesty Pike provide the best exposures of the Whorneyside Tuff Formation in its type area.

This sequence represents the first major explosive products in the Borrowdale Volcanic Group following the effusive- dominated lower part of the succession and is an important stratigraphic marker horizon. The bedded tuffs are considered to result from a subaerial phreato-plinian eruption, and as such are unique in the British Isles. Extensive soft sedimentation deformation structures in the bedded tuffs testify to considerable seismic activity and block faulting following upon the eruption and emplacement of the tuffs. This disturbance has been linked to the evacuation of a major magma chamber, the contents of which are now represented by the lower ignimbrite unit. The Whorneyside Formation is succeeded by acid pyroclastic rocks of the Airy's Bridge Formation. On Crinkle Crags a lower sequence of bedded eutaxitic tuffs and surge and fall deposits is overlain by massive ignimbrites and tuff breccias. The excellent exposures permit demonstration of active volcanotectonic faults which influenced the emplacment of these various units.

The section is continuous from the basal Ashdown Sand Formation (probably equivalent to top Purbeck sensu Dorset, which is probably Berriasian) to the lower Wadhurst Clay Formation (probably Valanginian). A broad facies change may be observed, from meander plain sediments (varicoloured lateritic clays and silts) in the lower Ashdown, to coastal braid-plain sandstones in the upper Ashdown Sand, and lagoonal/lake deposits in the Wadhurst Clay Formation (dark clays with a minor fandelta sandstone). Sedimentary structures on all scales are superbly displayed, the largest visible for long distances. Examples in the Ashdown are upward-fining, low-angle, point bar sequences and various types of channel and cross-bedded sandstone (up to 10m thick and traceable for up to 0.5km). In the Wadhurst Formation, pro-fandelta to top-fandelta sequences are seen in the lower and upper divisions respectively of the Cliff End Sandstone Member (10m). This in places may lie directly on the Ashdown. Detrital petrography reflects the overall facies trend, the lower Ashdown having local compositions (London-Kent massif material predominant), the upper Ashdown containing more exotic debris (mostly from Armorica), and the lower Wadhurst finally reverting to a parochial theme (Kent massif and local ironstone clasts). Diagenetic petrography of the clays and sandstones gives important evidence on the climate, soil conditions and burial-history of the rocks. Palaeobotanical features include locally abundant, drifted plant fragments (including spores), and upstanding plants in growth positions. Some of the latter were strictly confined to shallow water (Equisetum in the lower Ashdown and basal Wadhurst); others were more or less subaerial (Lycopodites in a silcrete palaeosol, and unidentified tree-stools in a leached palaeosol at the top of the Cliff End Sandstone; unidentified rootlets in varicoloured interchannel silts and clays; etc). The fossil soils and in situ plants support the theory of a warm semi-arid to monsoonal climate. This is strengthened by the anatomy of drifted tree fragments and by the sedimentological evidence. Animal fossils, entirely non-marine, include trace fossils, estherids, insects, molluscs, fish, reptiles (crocodile, turtles, dinosaurs, pterosaurs) and early mammals. The Cliff End Pebble Bed (Telham Pebble Bed) which is a rich repository of these, lies in the lower Wadhurst Clay above the Cliff End Sandstone Member. Dinosaur footprints (abundant in the Covehurst Sandstone Member) at the base of the Ashdown Group), rain prints and suncracks, occurring at intervals throughout the sequence, testify to periodic exposure of the sediments.

The saltmarsh morphology at Dengie is particularly interesting. The marsh surface stands mainly at 2.5m OD and is essentially planar with, unusually, no differentiation into upper and lower marsh. The marsh is dissected by numerous creeks and saltpan systems. Dengie also possesses many sub- surface pipes, a feature which has only been reported and examined at the saltmarshes in Nigg Bay, Scotland.

Particularly striking is the mutually exclusive distribution of palaeoniscids and malacostracan crustaceans. Foulden is the type locality for seven species of fishes, and it is the only locality for three; Actinopterygian (ray-finned) fishes are the commonest vertebrate fossils occurring at Foulden and these include four rare and important species which are ranked as stem-group neopterygians. They are, therefore, critical for studies of the early evolution of all living bony fishes and of the relationships between the Neopterygii and Chondrostei. Foulden is the type locality and only locality for one of these species, and the type locality for a further two. Acanthodian remains also occur here, and include complete specimens of the juvenile Acanthodes ovensi, which is the earliest known acanthodid and which is unique to this site. The first known complete rhizodont has also been found in the fish bed. The Rhizodontidae is an important but poorly known family of crossopterygian fishes. The rhizodont was a large fish with a widespread distribution, but which easily broke apart after death with the result that only scattered fragments are commonly found in the Upper Devonian and Carboniferous throughout the world. The species from Foulden is a small juvenile (c0.5m long) and it has been used to interpret the morphology and life style of the family. Bones from another, large, species are also found here.",Carboniferous,"FM,EO,EW",FOULDEN BURN

This rock unit is considered by to Upper Visean in age. These specimens include the first complete articulated amphibians found in the Scottish Carboniferous this century. Current and future research on these specimens and on the total ecosystem will allow the first ever observations of a lower Carboniferous terrestrial fauna. Seven species of amphibian have been recognised so far. The commonest form is a primitive temnospondyl, similar to Dendrerpeton, the first Visean temnospondyl to be found and, therefore, the earliest known temnospondyl. Dendrerpeton is the well-known genus commonly found in tree trunk traps in the Westphalian at Joggins, Nova Scotia. The temnospondyls are defined by their unique terrestrial hearing system (ie receptors for high-frequency air-borne sound). They are the ancestors of frogs and toads, so the discoveries at East Kirkton push back the terrestrial lineage of these modern amphibians still further. Two species, and possibly a third, of anthracosaur have been found including the first articulated anthracosaur skeleton from the Scottish Lower Carboniferous. Anthracosaurs are known from both aquatic and terrestrial forms and recent work suggest that there is a lineage between these amphibians, early reptiles and amniotes. Another new species is the earliest known loxommatid.

This region was sub-divided by H H Read into his celebrated zonation of migmatitic belts. West of Ben Klibreck, unmigmatised Moine metasediments crop out. Eastwards (and structurally up the succession), they pass transitionally into Read's zone of veins and thence into the zone of migmatite, which comprises migmatised pelitic gneisses and granitic sheets, situated along the top of Ben Klibreck. Also included within this site is the southern tip of the Naver Lewisian basement body. The relative importance of anatexis and metasomatism in migmatite genesis has always been, and still remains, a controversial issue. Within this context the Klibreck migmatites are highly significant, being the best known migmatites in Britain, which it has been suggested were produced primarily be Na-metasomatism. It is important that the Klibreck migmatites remain accessible and available for study as one of the few migmatite terranes in the British Isles.

This locality exposes a section across the spectacular Funzie conglomerate within the middle m‚lange. This unit separates the upper and lower ophiolite nappes on Fetlar and is believed to have formed during uplift and erosion of the lower nappe as it was transported to its current position. Ultrabasic rocks of the upper nappe (mainly harzburgites and dunites) are exposed at Staves Geo, where they rest with thrust contact above the Funzie conglomerate of the Phyllite Group. Deformation of the ultrabasic rocks in the hanging wall is largely confined to an anastomosing network of narrow shear zones in marked contrast to the strongly flattened and elongated quartzite pebbles within the conglomerate of the footwall. Moving south-eastwards towards The Snap, the spectacular thickness of the Funzie conglomerate can be demonstrated.

On the island of Unst, these rocks are overthrust by two nappes containing an association of ultrabasic and basic igneous rocks generally regarded as obducted fragments of oceanic crust and upper mantle (ie ophiolites sensu latu). Zones of tectonically mixed rocks (tectonic m‚langes) occur below, between and above the lower and upper ophiolite nappes and include low-grade metasedimentary rocks, known collectively as the Phyllite Group, together with lenses of hornblende schist. This locality exhibits the complex structural section beneath the upper ophiolite nappe which is exposed from Shure Taings northwards to the south side of The Taing. On the south side of Norwick Bay, ultrabasic rocks within the ophiolite nappe display limited deformation restricted to serpentinised shear zones that anastomose about largely undeformed and unaltered harzburgite. Northwards towards the Taing, the deformation becomes increasing pervasive until, at the thrust contact with the underlying Phyllite Group metasediments, the ultrabasics are essentially antigoritic S-C mylonites. Metasediments of the footwall form part of the middle m‚lange and comprise pelitic and graphitic phyllonites plus psammites, with lenses of serpentinite and hornblende schist. These exhibit complex non-coaxial deformation features with numerous kinematic/shear sense indicators that allow thrust transport directions to be determined. North-east of The Bungalow, superficially similar phyllonites, psammites and hornblende schists display less pervasive deformation. These belong to the Saxa Voord Block and are tentatively interpreted to represent a reworked slice of Dalradian-like basement, equivalent to parts of the East Mainland Succession. Further eastwards, towards Cliva Geo, these metasediments become intensively kinked and are eventually overlain by the spectacular Skaw Granite. Towards the contact the granite is mylonititic, with pink, semi-rounded K-feldspar augen upto 8cm long depicting an intense L-tectonite fabric. This is interpreted to reflect a thrust contact with metasediments of the Saxa Voord Block in the footwall and the Skaw Granite in the hanging wall. This site provides critical evidence of the complex structural relationships between ophiolitic and basement nappes that now occupy the eastern portions of the Shetland Isles. Precisely how these markedly contrasting lithotectonic blocks originally related to one another and how they became juxtaposed into their present-day configuration during Caledonian orogenesis remains unclear.

Thereby it has high potential for solving outstanding problems of correlation, palaeogeography and palaeoecology. Owing to low folding and some faulting, the section gives greater lateral coverage than the Sandown section. The Wessex Formation (around 170m seen), exposed in the core of the main anticline, comprises multicoloured interchannel clays and silts (some with upstanding plants) and channel sandstones (some with extrabasinal Cornubian pebbles). Fragments of subaerial and freshwater plants (ferns; gymnosperm leaves, cones, branches and trunks; charophytes) and of freshwater and land animals (fish, crocodiles, turtles, dinosaurs, pterosaurs) are locally common. With the evidence of suncracks, reptilian footprints, cornstones (caliche) and a wide range of other sedimentary structures, the site readily presents the picture of an alluvial plain with meandering streams under a warm monsoonal climate. Especially noteworthy is the Sandmoor Point Sandstone Member (6m) which extends for 1.9km. This shows superbly the sedimentological features of a meanderbelt sheet: channel forms and dimensions; an oxbow unit; flow directions; variations in stream power, discharge and cross-section; predominant suspension load but several types of sandbar, etc. The overlying Vectis Formation (thinning remarkably from 60m at the SE to less than 30m at the NW end of the section) is well-exposed. It comprises trangressing lake, lagoon and bay dark shales within thin ironstones, limestones and fluvial sandstones. Abundant fossils record a wide range of salinities, the highest near the top. Rhythmic, thin, fining upwards cycles of brackish facies with basal erosion surfaces and gutter casts may have been generated by exceptionally heavy runoff during monsoonal storms. The Barnes High Sandstone Member association is thought to be of a fan delta invading the lagoon and the Cowleaze Chine Member a lagoonal sandflat. Palaeontologically, the section is famous for its wealth of plant and animal fossils and has great potential. Petrographically, too, much work remains to be done.

Ore distribution was largely cotrolled by the Tyndrum Fault along which the metal-rich fluids rose from depth. The fluids then passed into the metasediments where permeable fractures intersected the fault. At Tyndrum Main Mine the mineralisation was localised in the Hard Vein, which occupies a fracture dipping steeply to the south-east, near to its termination against the fault. The Hard Vein was heavily worked in the past and little in situ material remains. Nonetheless the relationship of the vein to the fault can be readily appreciated and the mineralogy is well- represented in the extensive mine dumps. The principal ores consist of coarse galena and sphalerite with minor chalcopyrite in a quartz- gangue. Recent studies of the dump material have enabled a number of different breccia- and vein-ores to be recognised and a detailed paragenetic sequence has been established. The dumps provide an excellent example of base-metal vein mineralisation and the site is of metallogenetic importance in this regard. A further mineralogical interest is the presence of sulphosalts in the galena, especially a cadmium-rich variety of the mineral tetrahedrite. Tyndrum is the world type locality for this variety, being the only known occurrence",,FD,
2811,"Cullen - Troup Head, Banffshire Coast",Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire,Dalradian,,Notified,NJ617660,57.68,-2.64,361700,866000,15-Dec-88,30-Dec-88,SNH,"This large site contains the classic coastal cross-section of the Banffshire Dalradian, ranging from the Cullen Quartzite of the lowermost Lochaber Subgroup to the Macduff Slates of the uppermost Southern Highland Group. One of the most important features of this Banffshire Dalradian is its relatively low metamorphic grade, which means that many of the original sedimentary features of the rocks are preserved. This site may be considered in six sections. Banffshire Coast 1: Cullen to West Sands This, the westernmost part of the Banffshire coastal section, exposes the lowermost Banffshire Dalradian, correlated with the Appin Group. The site begins on the east side of Cullen Bay where towards the harbour pier Cullen Quartzite of the lower Lochaber Subgroup occurs dipping out to sea in three discontinuous outcrops. East of the harbour, round Logie Head to West Sands, are good outcrops of quartzitic to rather pelitic, often porphyroblastic, metasediments of the West Sands Mica Schists (upper Lochaber Subgroup), which contain good sedimentary structures.  Banffshire Coast 2: Findlater to Sandend At Findlater Castle the lower Ballachulish Subgroup Findlater Flags include vertical ripple-marked quartzites. These are succeeded eastwards by the calcareous Cairnfield Actinolitic Flags of the upper Ballachulish Subgroup, which are notable for the presence of green radiating actinolite needles. Southwards are seen interbedded grey limestones and black slates.  Sandend Bay to Portsoy Old Harbour At the east side of Sandend Bay local patches of Old Red Sandstone unconformably overlie the Sandend Limestone Group of the Blair Atholl Subgroup of the Appin Dalradian. North-eastwards the limestones are overlain by the Durn Hill Quartzite (Argyll Group) which are exposed around Redhythe Point. These Islay Subgroup rocks are succeeded eastwards by the more varied pelites, limestones, quartzites and black schists of the Portsoy Group (Easdale Subgroup), which occur west of Portsoy itself. Within these metasediments occurs the Portsoy gabbro, serpentinite and one of the very few British occurrences of anorthosite. The differing responses of these highly varied rock-types to strongly heterogeneous deformation have resulted in a type of tectonic melange, with tectonic inclusions within the schists (one of these inclusions being the anorthosite body), strong shearing of serpentinite and gabbro lithologies, and the development of strong lineations including mullions in quartzite. The easterly increase in metamorphic grade is indicated by the presence of kyanite in the schists of this area.  Portsoy New Harbour to Whitehills This is probably the most important part of the whole Banffshire Coast site, because of its tectonics. This section cuts through the steeply dipping western limb of the Boyndie Bay synform, beginning at the west side of Links Bay on Portsoy Group metasediments. On the east side of the bay these metaseiments are overlain by the Cowhythe Gneiss along the Portsoy Thrust. This gneiss is believed to be an allochthonous unit of high grade pre-Dalradian basement, interposed between the Keith and Banff Divisions of the north-eastern Dalradian. The gneisses have an extensive polyphase deformation history, mainly acquired prior to the development of the Boyndie Bay synform. The upper boundary of the gneiss unit is exposed at Old Hythe where a shear zone, the Boyne Line of Read, separates the Cowhythe Gneiss from limestones and sillimanite-bearing schists of the Boyne Limestone, which is correlated with the upper Argyll Tayvallich Subgroup. These rocks, lying above the thrust Cowhythe Gneiss, must also be allochthonous and comprise the Banff Nappe, which was apparently emplaced after the formation of the D1 Tay Nappe. The lower part of the Banff Nappe consists of the Boyne Limestone and the pelites and calcareous clastics of the Lower Whitehills Group (uppermost Argyll Group), which are well-exposed between Boyne Bay and Whitehills.

Red Sike Moss is important for reconstructing Holocene vegetation history in upper Teesdale, an area of outstanding botanical importance. The pollen stratigraphy supported by radiocarbon dating, demonstrates that many relict species survived from the Late-glacial and during the Holocene. It also demonstrates the development of open woodland and its subsequent replacement by blanket bog on the drift soils and later by grassland on the limestone. Its palaeecological development can be compared with both lowland sites in County Durham and higher sites on the Moor House National Nature Reserve.

Such swarms are a characteristic feature of the lower crust in an ophiolite, and their occurrence at Porthousestock indicates it to be the highest structural level of the Lizard ophiolite to be preserved. Geochemical studies have shown that the dykes and the enclosing host gabbro are chemically related with the dykes being more evolved than the gabbro parent. Contact relations are varied with some dykes showing sharp chilled margins while others with lobate junctions and no chilling are indicative of injection into hot gabbro.

This site marks the first locality south of Polzeath not affected by southwards backthrusting. The backthrusting is associated with southwards transport of the Culm Basin and the development of south facing recumbent folds. These can be seen as far as Polzeath where there is confrontation with earlier north facing structures. At Stepper Point the early north facing structures are overprinted by a latter cleavage and folds associated with renewed northwards translation.

There are three generations of folds and associated cleavages cut by a series of steep NE-SW extensional faults. The section lies at right angles to the dominant north-easterly strike of the structure. Exposures of thin-bedded Mylor slates show an eastwards transition to more proximal Gramscatho turbidites. The stratigraphy is cut up into a number of fault-bound packages which probably contain repetitions of parts of the sequence. Within some slices there is a suggestion of fining up from slate to greywacke.  Major faults such as the Carrick and Blue Rock Thrusts are interpreted to imbricate proximal and transitional facies of the Gramscatho Group, carrying them north-westwards over more distal basinal facies of the younger Mylor Slate Formation. These low angle structures appear, in many cases, to have been subsequently re-activated as high angle extensional faults. First generation folds are especially well-represented in the striped Mylor slates. Folds and thrusts marking the second regional deformation phase are intermittently developed throughout the section but are more prominent towards Loe Bar.

This site is significant in the development of ideas concerning the structural history of south-west England, as it was argued by Lambert in 1959 that the folds were generated synchronously during one phase of deformation. Subsequently the pattern of deformation has been reinterpreted as resulting from the interference of structures of two separate episodes of crustal shortening. Close to tight first generation folds are present throughout the section. The attitude of these folds is modified by second generation folding which steepens and overturns the earlier structures.

Downholland Moss is a key reference site for establishing relative sea-level changes in north-west England during the period from about 8000–4000 years BP. Alternating organic and inorganic deposits represent a sequence of changing tidal flat, lagoonal and perimarine palaeoenvironments. These have been the subject of detailed stratigraphical, micro- and macro-palaeontological analyses, supported by radiocarbon dating. The results have provided a detailed record of three marine phases in the deeper parts of the moss, transgressive and regressive overlaps, a partial chronology of tendencies of sea-level movement in north-west England and sea-level index points. Transgressions had their source from the proto-Alt estuary to the south-west, rather than the west which suggests a barrier here throughout most of the Holocene. Downholland Moss has also given detailed information for the first time in north-west England for the stratigraphy and morphology of roddon landforms. Throughout the Holocene Downholland Moss appears to have been a mosaic of freshwater, salt-marsh and brackish water lagoon, wetland habitats, behind a sand barrier to the west.

Hawes Water is important for reconstructing Devensian Late-glacial and Holocene vegetation history and environmental change in the south Cumbrian Lowlands. It is one of only four carbonate lakes in northern England and the only lake of natural origin remaining in Lancashire. It provides both a pollen and lithostratigraphical record for the Carboniferous Limestone area that shows uninterrupted lake deposition from the end-Devensian through to the mid-Holocene and which allows the study of lake level change and comparisons with the vegetational development in adjacent uplands and lowlands. The importance of the sedimentary archive is re-inforced by the carbonate sediments which are known to be particularly sensitive to climate and anthropogenic impacts. The sensitivity of the record is best shown by the identification of four, short term climatic fluctuations during the Late-glacial, recording a degree of climatic instability previously unrecorded at English sites.

Wybunbury Moss is an important example of a deep basin mire of schwingmoor structure, with a floating raft of peat overlying 13 m of open water. Pollen stratigraphy, macrofossil and chemical analyses have been used to reconstruct the vegetation history and development of the mire. The results suggested that subsidence through solution of the sub-surface salt deposits has been more important than the typical pattern of hydroseral colonisation of an open-water lake basin.

Scaleby Moss is a key site for reconstructing Devensian Late-glacial and Holocene vegetation change in the Cumbrian lowlands. The pollen record is supported by radiocarbon dating which provides a geochronological framework for interpreting the environmental history and it was one of the first sites in Britain where the pollen record and zonation was dated using this method. It shows a classic raised bog development with recurrence surfaces in its upper part. Scaleby Moss also provides important comparisons with the vegetation history of adjacent uplands in the northern Pennines and the Lake District and in the adjacent Cumbrian lowlands. It contrasts with many other such sites in the lowlands because it was developed in clay-rich soils, derived from proglacial and glaciolacustrine silts and clays that were incorporated into the Scottish Readvance till.

These contain many new, as yet undescribed, palaeoniscid fish, and also fossil sharks of kinds which were previously unkown from Britain. Well-preserved fossil fish of this age are rare throughout the world. The Bearsden sharks are the best preserved cartilagenous fish known from the Palaeozoic. Complete fossil sharks are poorly known, and descriptions and classification are based mainly on teeth which are all that is usually preserved, the cartilagenous structures have a poor chance of being fossilised. Outside North America, Carboniferous marine sharks have only been described from Glencartholm, and non-marine sharks are known exclusively from the Edinburgh area (although this non-marine origin is now disputed). Stethacanthus is a shark from Bearsden which has a peculiar large calcified and toothed triangular structure attached to the dorsal spine. It is poorly understood but it is possible that this may have had a sexual role. It is also known from poorer material from Montana. Bearsden has also yielded the first complete brayodont from Britain. Eleven new palaeoniscid species occur at Bearsden, represented by complete and well-preserved specimens including species of Elonichthys, Rhadinichthys, and Mesopoma. This fauna bears no relationship to any other known Carboniferous assemblage in the world, which raises palaeoenvironmental problems. Chirodus crassus, a large chirodontid, is present in the assemblage. This is the only occurrence of complete, well-preserved specimens and allows the accurate description of the complete fish for the first time. Acanthodians are present, and the first known Carboniferous acanthodian brain-case has been found here.

Continued transgression then led to the deposition of the sandy sideritic limestone that normally marks the base of the Cornbrash.",Jurassic,Inland Outcrops and Stream Sections,NEWTONDALE

The Hackness Rock rests unconformably on the Langdale Beds, and comprises 2 metres of calcareous shales and sandy limestones with fossils characteristic of the athleta Zone; it is overlain by the Oxford Clay. Comparison of the detailed rock sequence seen here with that seen on the coast around Scarborough show that depositional environments fluctuated rapidly during Callovian times in the North Yorkshire area.

The geological relationships at Cairnloch, within this site, have been interpreted as showing Grampian Group unconformably overstepping various lithologies of the Central Highland Division. Within the southern part of the site, at Carn Cruinn the Grampian Group and Central Highland Division are apparently juxtaposed along a zone of ductile shear, the Grampian Thrust (slide). The recent recognition of these two units has caused a major revision of the stratigraphy and structure of the Central Highlands. The older Central Highland Division is generally accepted to be broadly equivalent to the Glenfinnan Division of the Moine north of the Great Glen. The younger Grampian Group is now widely regarded as the lowest group of a four part Dalradian Supergroup. The fact that minerals developed along the line of the Grampian Thrust give radiometric ages of 750Ma apparently makes the straightforward assignment of the Grampian Group to the lowermost Dalradian improbable. If the upper part of the Grampian Group passes, without break, upwards into the lower Palaeozoic part of the Dalradian, the lower part of the Grampian Group could hardly be involved in ductile shearing in the amphibolite facies at 750Ma. The relationships seen in this site are critical to the local reinterpretation, and they remain the subject of controversy. Thus the geotectonic situation is now one of tectonic inliers of parts of the Moine Succession (Central Highland Division) within the Grampian Group, which until more evidence is forthcoming, is best regarded as the lowermost part of the Dalradian Supergroup.",Precambrian,EO,

It is the northernmost part of the Strath Halladale migmatite-granite complex and there are a number of places where the unconformable contact with the overlying Old Red Sandstone breccias and sandstones is well-developed. At least three different ages of granites can be recognised within this site. Just north of the pier [NC882658] an augen granite is exposed. The augen are rather indistinct with ghost-like folds. There is a considerable similarity with the Clerkhill augen granites of the Bettyhill area. Further north [NC658882] schistose biotitised amphibolite crops out which contains a development of augen granite. This is cut by pink granite veins, whilst both the amphibolite and the pink veins are cut by a zone of red granitic sheets which are probably part of the Strath Halladale granite. Thus the amphibolite contains three granites of different ages, and is itself probably older than all of them. The fine development of the Old Red Sandstone overlying the unconformity is itself of first rate importance. However, the main interest of this site lies in its clear exposition of relationships within the Strath Halladale migmatite-granite complex. These areas are rarely seen inland due to very poor exposure in critical areas. The greatest significance attaches to the red granitic sheets, which are believed to be part of the Strath Halladale granite dated at 649ñ30 Ma.

There are many examples of granite and pegmatite veins within this area, both foliated and unfoliated, which clearly crosscut and are later than the early (D1) regional migmatisation. At least four phases of deformation can be distinguished. The early (D1) regional gneissification and migmatisation produced fabrics which are folded by later tight folds (F2). These are both refolded by later (F3) folds, eg [NC698630]. Other F3 folds are well-displayed at Creag Ruadh [NC696630] where tight upright folds are accompanied by a remarkable (?F2) eye fold [NC696630] which shows extreme hinge curvilinearity, a feature of the local (F2) folds. On the east side of Creag Ruadh a variety of late crosscutting pegmatites, microgranites and lamprophytic sheets occur. The Ard Mor amphibolite forms a series of discontinuous bodies extending along the strike through the area. This has been shown to be part of the early (pre-D1) tholeiitic intrusive suite. The early D1 metamorphism produced a moderately coarse garnet amphibolite, whilst later deformation and metamorphism progessively reduces this to fine grained hornblende schist. Discontinuously developed in the vicinity of the amphibolite is a singular quartz-biotite rock which has been explained as a high-strain restite produced from the partial melting of psammitic gneiss.

Further east [NC538451] two prominent lensoid bodies of serpentinite have given rise to an ice-carried train of boulders, which is marked on Geological Survey maps as a large intrusion. It has been argued on geochemical grounds that this serpentinite originated as olivine cumulate from Loch a'Mhoid metagabbro magma. The interest at this site is multifaceted. First there are the Meadie schists and Meadie pelite, unusual lithologies probably derived from the Lewisian basement, which contains a wealth of tectonic and petrological evidence concerning Moine orogenesis and reworking of the basement. If the Meadie pelite is Lewisian in origin its use as an indicator of kyanite grade Moine metamorphism is highly questionable.

The Bettyhill assemblage gneisses above the thrust contain large, relatively late pegmatite bodies, and are variably migmatitised, but the migmatisation is structurally very early (D1), and clearly pre- dates the thrust movement. The importance of this site is that it represents the northern extremity of the Naver Thrust, which separates the early regional migmatites of east Sutherland from the unmigmatised Moine to the west. The nature of this boundary is rather controversial, many writers have assumed it is the lateral extension of the Sgurr Beag Thrust (slide), with the overlying rocks being the northern equivalents of the Glenfinnan division. However, recent chemostratigraphic work suggests the Bettyhill assembage is equivalent to high grade Morar division.

The marshes are important geomorphologically for the development of creeks, saltpans and distinct terraces on the saltmarsh surface which may be a response to isostatic uplift and changing sea-levels. Old creek patterns can be traced on the raised beaches along the Solway Firth; this gives evidence for the existence of extensive saltmarshes in the estuary in the past.

Near the unconformity the Triassic rocks are cut by calcite veins containing flecks of galena and concretionary swellings of platy barite. Along the coast between Pant y Slade and Fairy Cave the unconformity in the Carboniferous Limestone lies on a wave-cut platform and is overlain by Lower Jurassic (Liassic) breccias which form on the cliff face on the landward side. The basal breccia is pervasively mineralised with calcite, barite and disseminated coarse galena with at least three generations of mineralisation distinguishable. The mineralisation is syngenetic in character and is the result of a fumarolic system extruding on the Liassic sea floor. Similar mineralisation, but in the form of epigenetic veins, can be seen in the underlying Carboniferous Limestone at Pant y Slade. The veins pass upwards into solution fissures filled with mineralised Liassic breccias, but do not cut through the unconformity as such. Concentrations of mineralisation in the basal Liassic breccia, however correspond with an upward projection of the veins and fissures suggesting that solution fractures in the Carboniferous Limestone, as well as becoming infilled with Lias debris, acted as conduits for mineralising fluids.

The gravels are of fluvial origin and belong to the 2nd terrace of the Blackwater, a former tributary of the River Thames.  They were deposited By a braided river under periglacial conditions.

The organic clays and silts interbedded with the river gravels have ieilded mammel bones, pollen, plant remains, insects and ostracods which indicate cold climate conditions at the time of deposition.  The mammalian fauna includes an assemblage of Canus lupus (wolf), Crocuta crocuta (spotted hyaena), Rangifer tarandus (reindeer), Megaloceros (giant deer), Bison (Bovoid), Coelodonta antiquitatis (woolly rhinoceros), Equus ferus (horse), and Mammuthus primigenius (wolly mammoth).  Numerous species of Coleoptera have also been found, indicating species no longer native to Great Britain (Diacheila polita, Bembidion (Plataphodes), Bembidion (Plataphus), Amaramunicipalis and Amara Torrida).

The importance of the site lies in its stratigraphical position with the Thames system.  It appears to represent the Devensian (last glacial) stage, which is seldom found in conservable locations above floodplain level in the Thames system.  There is however some indication from the fossil insects that the deposits may belong to an older glacial event which pre-dates the Ipswichian (last interglacial).  If the deposits are of pre-Ipswichian age, they represent a period for which there is little other faunal evidence in the Thames basin.  If the deposits are of Devensian age, the fossil remains provide new evidence for a previously unrecognised cold episode.

The designated site conserves the late-Llandeilo/early-Caradoc age, 500m thick, Coreswall Point memberof the Corsewall Formation.  This is composed of comglomerate , a rock containing boulders and pebbles of other rocks, eg. granite, gabbro and chert, set in a matrix of sandstone.  The excellent exposure, large size of the boulders and strategic positioning of the conglomerate combine to make it one of the most important sites for interpreting the geology of Scotland in Lower Palaeozoic times.

The conglomerate has been interpreted as a channel fill sequence within a submarine fan.  It was deposited in a large ocean located between ancient Scottish and English continental landmasses prior to their collision at the end of the Silurian Period.  The superb exposure of the sedimentary structures at the site make it one of the best and most studied examples of a submarine fan complex in Europe.  Recent studies of the boulders suggest they had a source not in Scotland, but in north-west Newfoumdland.  This would require a left handed horizontal movement of at least 1500km taking place along the Southern Uplands Fault during the collision of the Scottish and English continents.

It is one of only two remaining exposures of the 'Wilmington Sands', a deposit limited to the area immediately around Wilmington Village.  This deposit is unique in Britain although it has close similarities to sands known in the Sarthe region of western France (Macfadyan 1970).  It dates from the upper part of the Cretaceous Period, around 100 million years ago, and was laid down in a shallow tropical sea which covered much of Britain at this time.

Of particular interest is the fossil fauna of the 'Wilmington Sands', which at Reeds Pit include a shell bed full of bivalve mollusc shells and some ammonites (the shells of extinct relatives of modern squids).  The ammonites include several very rare species and are internationally important for dating rocks of this age.  Many sea urchins also occur in the sands and occasional crabs are present (including the species Calappa cranium, which was first found at this locality.

The richness of some of the internationally important faunas, especially the correllative elements (ie. ammonites) makes Reeds Farm Pit of national and international importance.  Although the succession is broadly similar to that of nearby Wilmington Quarry (= White Hard Sandpit) SSSI, many significant differences are present and Reeds Farm Pit has yielded better preserved specimens of certain faunal elements which have featured in a number of important monographs.

Important biostratigraphical information demonstrates that the Bideford Formation is laterally equivalent to the upper part of the Crackington Formation and the basal part of the Bude Formation of adjacent areas.  The site remarkably includes one such marker band characterised by the ammonoid Gastrioceras amaliae (Langsettian Stage) within both a Crackington Formation sequence at Babbacome Mouth and within a Bideford Formation sequence west of Cornborough, thereby proving the lateral equivalence of the two formations.

In addition to marine horizons the Bideford formation yields important non-marine bivalve assemblages including faunas of the Carbonicola lenisulcata Zone.  The formation is dominated by mudstones, siltstones and some sandstones representing at least nine deposition cycles.  Sedimentary structures including cross-stratification are locally well developed and interesting trace-fossil assemblages are also present.

Peterborough's brickpits are the source of abundant ammonites, these have been the subject of one of the most detailed studies ever attempted.  Specimens of the genus Kosmoceras were collected in the 1920's cm by cm through the clays and evolutionary changes assessed through time.  These studies have recently been reviewed in the light of contemporary evolutionary theory.

Some ammonites are fundamental to international correlation (ie. dating) of Callovian rocks and include stratotype (ie. global reference) localities for four divisions of geological time, namely the Medea Subzone and the Jason Subzone of the Jason Zone, and the Obductum and Grossouvrei Subzones of the Coronatum Zone.

Particularly spectacular are the incomplete remains of the giant fish Leedsichythys, a genus probably reaching over 30-40m in length. the fauna is exceptionally diverse and includes sharks and rays (Hybodus, Asteracanthus, Notidanus, Protospinax, Paracastracion, Heterodontus, Orectoloboides, Spathobatis), chimaerids (Ischyodus, Brachymylus, Pachymylus, Leptacanthus) and bony fish (Mesturas, Lepidotes, Heterostrophus, Caturas, Osteorachis, Asthenocormus, Leedsichythys, Hypsocormus, Aspidorhynchus, Lepidotes, Pholidophorus).

The same factor which makes the Peterborough Member important for fish remains, also make it exceptionally important for reptile remains.  Marine species, especially plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and icthyosaurs are particularly prominent in the fauna and accompanied by frequent sea-crocodiles.  Remarkably, dinosaur and pterosaur remains also occasionally occur.

Peterborough is considered to be the richest source of Callovain marine reptiles in Britain and possibly the world.  Many species were first described from the district.  The fauna includes icthyosaurs (Opthalmosauras), plesiosaurs (Muraenosauras, Tricleidus, Cryptoclidus), pliosaurs (Liopleurodon, Simolestes, Pleoneustes, 'Pliosaurus'), crocodiles (Steneosauras, Metriorhynchus), sauropod dinosaurs (Cetiosauriscus, Ornithopsis), ornithopod dinosaurs (Callovosaurus), stegosaur dinosaurs (Lexoisaurus), ankylosaur dinosaurs (Sarcolestes), a possible theropod and pterosaurs (Rhamphorhynchus).",Jurassic,Active Quarries and Pits,

In West Cumbria the mineralisation typically occurs in veins and flats, but in the Furness area the deposits occur as 'sops' - large and spectacular karstic conical collapse structures, now seen as surface hollows following extraction of the ore.

The dominant grain constituents are crystals and fragments of fine-grained volcanic rock, suggesting that the turbidite flows were in some way triggered by volcanic eruption.  However, the extent of sedimentary reworking during turbulent flowage has masked any evidence for primary volcanic processes and has produced lithologies that are best described as ‘volcaniclastic’ rather than ‘pyroclastic’ in nature.

Sedimentary structures in the tuffaceous siltstone facies grouping indicate subaqueous deposition at moderate depths (at least) by a combination of turbidity current activity and the direct fall-out of fine ash.  This fine-grained sedimentation either took place at some distance from the active volcanoes, or reflects times of relative quiescence.  The crystal-lapilli tuff facies grouping, in contrast, is extremely coarse-grained and its remarkable uniformity of appearance, combined with its abundance of juvenile pyroclastic material (euhedral and shattered crystals, glass shards), suggests that it may have been generated by highly explosive, large-volume eruptions followed by subaqueous flowage of the ejected material.

It preserves complete cycles of sedimentation, a typical example commencing in dacitic crystal-lapilli tuff that remains massive over thicknesses of up to 50 m before passing up to a relatively thinner, stratified and graded upper part.  This kind of variation has its parallel in young volcanic arcs elsewhere in the world and is attributed to the action of subaqueous pyroclastic flows carrying crystal-rich material derived from highly explosive eruptions.  The flowage emplacement of these beds is underlined by phenomena indicating mass-instability of the sedimentary pile, such as the horizons of sediment-raft breccia and other soft sediment deformation structures occurring in association with the crystal-lapilli tuffs.  The intervening finer-grained beds of tuffaceous siltstone contain accretionary lapilli and these, albeit rare in occurrence, testify to subaerial, or shallow water, pyroclastic activity in the volcanic source region(s).  Explosive volcanic activity is typical of quartz phenocryst-rich, dacitic magmas, but the occurrence of quartz-poor tuffs also indicates the coexistence of andesitic or basaltic magmas within this arc system.  The quarry exposures demonstrate a full sequence of Precambrian intrusion, post-dating the volcanism.  Initially, basaltic to andesitic intrusions, chemically identical to the North Charnwood Diorites of Charnwood Forest, were intruded along northerly-trending faults.  They were then cross-cut by north-easterly-trending faults, which in part controlled the margins of a granophyric diorite stock.  The radiometric age of 603 Ma for this intrusion therefore constrains a time at which major changes in magmatism and tectonic style were occurring within the Charnian volcanic arc during the lead-up to its cessation.

This may only be part of the story, however, because the few horizons with sedimentary structures suggest that deposition occurred on a wet substrate.  Basic rocks are restricted to minor developments of chloritic tuffs or microgabbro intrusions, locally converted to chlorite schists, in the upper (i.e. westernmost) part of the sequence.  Following deposition, the succession was affected by unevenly-distributed deformation involving westwards tilting and the progressive steepening of beds, which became sub-vertical to locally overturned, and penetratively cleaved, on the eastern flank of the inlier.

Some volcanic rocks of the Castell Cogan Rhyolite Member are associated with unusual types of breccias, in keeping with an origin as rhyolitic or basaltic lava flows or domes emplaced in shallow waters.  Explosive eruptions also took place, generating the ash-flow tuffs, and it is probable that all of this activity occurred in a continental margin setting, along the axis of a volcanic arc that was undergoing rifting.  Erosion of these lavas produced abundant debris, which accumulated to form the thick volcaniclastic deposits of the Coed Cochion Member.

These original textures were largely overprinted and obscured by a later deformation that has resulted in the development of an impersistent rodding fabric and foliation, accompanied by extensive recrystallization of the granite.

about 8 kilometres north west of Much Wenlock.
The exposures in Bullhill Brook lie within the Arenaceous Beds, forming the uppermost

belong to the uppermost part of the Shumardia salopensis Biozone, and consist of a series
of laminated or micaceous shales interbedded with seams of grit or sandstone. The latter
show flute and prod marks on their basal surfaces, indicating that they originated as
turbidites. Bullhill Brook is the only site where a fossil fauna has been recovered from the
Arenaceous Beds.
The Arenaceous Beds contains a rich fauna of exceptionally well preserved trilobites

Orometopidae, Remopleurididae and Shumardidae. Several of the trilobite species are new
and the types originate from this site. The fauna also contains five genera of calcichordates
including a new genus, Prochauvelicystis, and Anatifopsis, a new genus of eocrinoid.
Inarticulate brachiopods also occur.
The trilobite genera consist of widespread taxa, and as such are typical of an outer shelf
fauna. However the absence of any planktonic fauna in the form of graptolites indicates that
these beds may have been deposited in a basin largely cut off from oceanic circulation. The
relative abundance of olenid trilobites at some levels indicates periodic low oxygen
concentrations in the water. The calcichordates and shumardiid trilobites were both adapted
for semi-infaunal feeding, indicating that the muds were rich in organic material.
This site is important not only for its fauna, but because it represents the youngest rocks of

The Cobbler and the surrounding Arrochar Alps and Cowal hills provide an important opportunity to understand this process, and to seek to quantify and date it.  Containing the densest large cluster of rock-slope failures in Scotland, they provide an exceptional locus for research into the causes of rock-slope failure and its possible significance as an indicator of shifting ice centres and dispersal patterns.  Relicts of the pre-glacial land surface on The Cobbler and its neighbours provide scope for landscape reconstruction, in one of the upland areas of Britain most intensely dissected by glacial breaching.
The Cobbler itself has a variety of types of rock-slope failure representative of its occurrence in the Dalradian schists of the south-west Highlands.  As one of the best-known and most idiosyncratically-shaped mountains in Britain, in a conspicuous and accessible location in the new Loch Lomond & Trossachs National Park, The Cobbler is also well suited for research into geomorphological education, geotourism, and widening public awareness of landscape origins.

It is possible to reconstruct a pre-failure topography that confirms the scale on which such paraglacial mass movements can enlarge a corrie.  It is then possible to project forwards a process whereby further rock-slope failure increments will eliminate the corrie headwall and pave the way for dissection of the whole mountain block by glacial breaching.  The adjacent rock-slope failures on the north-east shoulder and on Meall a’ Chleirich afford instructive comparators at different stages of corrie and breach initiation and evolution, including impressive evidence of incipient rock-slope failure which appears still to be actively propagating.  There is considerable scope here for detailed investigations into the geometry and mechanics of a classic arrested translational slide, and into the sequence of rock-slope failure activity probably over more than one glacial cycle.  Ben Hee also nicely illustrates the slow dawning of awareness of the existence of montane rock-slope failure in Scotland.  Finally, the existence of this small and isolated cluster of rock-slope failures indicates that erosion both by corrie glaciers and by transfluent ice breaching has been sufficiently intense in the Late Devensian to destabilize mountain slopes even in the far north of Scotland.

3267,"Carn Dubh, Ben Gulabin",Perth and Kinross and Stirling,Mass movement,,Confirmed,NO100721,0.00,0.00,0,0,30-Jun-05,,SNH,"Sometime after the final deglaciation of Gleann Beag some 11 500–12 000 years ago, up to 600 000 tonnes of rock below Carn Dubh failed by sliding of interbedded quartzites and phyllites along bedding planes that dip towards the valley at angles of around 34°.  Rupture occurred in the phyllites, which were probably weakened by post-glacial stress-release, though the failure trigger may have been high water pressure or a seismic shock generated by re-activation of the nearby Gleann Taitneach fault.
	The Carn Dubh landslide represents an outstanding example of a rock-slope failure where runout involved viscous flow of debris, producing thick elongate debris tongues that extended downslope from the foot of the failure scar.  This phenomenon is very rare on the metamorphic rocks that underlie most of the Scottish Highlands; only one other example is documented.  Fragmentation and flow of mobile rockslide debris around a central protrusion resulted in the deposition of two thick debris tongues, 320 m and 380 m long, flanked by massive bouldery levées up to 12 m high.  These thick debris-tongues resemble those produced by hillslope debris-flows, but are an order of magnitude larger.  Movement of the boulders in the debris tongues probably took the form of inertial grainflow sustained by the momentum of colliding boulders, with coarse debris partially buoyant in mobile mud.  The degree to which movement was aided by loading and liquifaction of underlying glacial deposits is uncertain, though comparison with a similar site in Knoydart suggests that formation of massive debris-lobes such as those below the Carn Dubh rockslide was not dependent on deformation of underlying sediments.  The internal composition of the massive flow-tongues suggests that flow generated by the momentum of the initial rockslide involved a mixture of expelled water, crushed phyllites, quartzite boulders and a minor component of entrained till.  Debris flow at this site was probably aided by focusing of runout debris around the central protrusion and runout on to initially steep gradients.

The exceptionally large mass and height of fall of this landslide provided sufficient energy to cause boulder-sized debris to move as a grainflow or fragmental flow that surged up the opposite side of the corrie then moved downslope along the corrie floor.  The debris came to rest as a tongue-shaped boulder deposit 1.25 km long, up to 380 m wide and up to 15 km thick.  The site of rock failure is represented by a deep scar on the cliff face, bounded on both sides by near-vertical fault scarps up to 60 m high that converge near the summit of the mountain.
	The Beinn Alligin landslide is classified as an excess-runout rock avalanche (sturzstrom) and is probably the largest and finest example of its type in Great Britain.  It is thought to have occurred due to ‘rebound’ or stress-release in the rock after it emerged from under the weight of the last ice-sheet.  Stress-release resulted in the opening of joints (discontinuities) in the rock, so that the cliff became progressively weaker through time.  The landslide may, however, have been triggered by movement along one or both of the faults that border the failure scar, causing the collapse of rock already weakened by stress release.  The Beinn Alligin rock avalanche is the largest slope-failure in Torridon sandstone bedrock.  Its occurrence several millennia after final deglaciation suggests that the effects of unloading of rock from under the weight of the last ice-sheet continued to influence mountain-wall stability throughout most of the post-glacial period, and may persist to the present day.(from Mass Movement draft, by Colin Ballantyne, June 2005)",,IS,

Vast deposits of hematite in west and south Cumbria were intensively exploited during the 19th century for their high-grade, low- phosphorus iron ores. The deposits were mined from Carboniferous Limestones, mainly of Visean age, which surround the Lake District Dome and contrast sharply with the sulphide mineralisation more typically associated with the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the area. The deposits are epigenetic and are believed to result from metasomatism of the limestones by downward-moving hypersaline brines which introduced iron from the overlying Permo-Triassic sandstones.

 At Windergill Mine moderate sized dumps remain from working of this typical west Cumbrian hematite mine. The deposit consisted essentially of hematite, with minor quantities of quartz, dolomite, calcite and barite. A little siderite is also present. No good exposures of typical west Cumbrian hemetite replacement mineralisation are available at the surface today and the mineralogy of the deposits can only be studied readily from dump material.

It is bound by a Tertiary dyke to the west and is undercut by a Tertiary sill intrusion exposed on the seaward side to the east (Cox 2002, Clark et al. 2004). Within the thicker section of Tertiary sill above An Corran, is a raft of baked Kilmaluag Formation ostracod-rich sediments, suggesting that the sliver of Duntulm Formation on the foreshore is from close to the top of the Duntulm Formation. Dinosaur footprints are found at the top of two bioturbated calcareous sandstones. The lower of the two sandstones contained paired vertical burrows (?Arenicolites), and Rhizocorallium along with large theropod dinosaur footprints, and the upper sandstone contained large numbers of simple vertical tubes (Skolithos)as well as a smaller ornithopod dinosaur footprint that was found on a loose block (Clark et al. 2004). These footprints include the largest theropod footprints to be found in Scotland, the only dinosaur remains from the Duntulm Formation, and a significant addition to the dinosaurs represented in the Middle Jurassic of the Isle of Skye. These footprints are also the only exposed in situ dinosaur footprints in Scotland.
The sediments are poorly represented and are difficult to correlate with any other exposure of the Duntulm Formation in Trotternish, Isle of Skye. The GCR interest in this site is with the Middle Jurassic dinosaur trackways that are found in situ and in loose blocks on the foreshore. The presence of these Middle Jurassic dinosaur footprints ties in with work being carried out in NE England, and Oxfordshire, England, as well as elsewhere on the Isle of Skye. They are an important addition to our understanding of British, European and World Middle Jurassic dinosaur faunas. Similar footprints have been found in Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of North America, Asia and Europe and the Upper Triassic of North America, however accurate diagnosis of dinosaur footprints is problematic and a review of ichnotaxonomic methodology is required. It will be important that these footprints are included in such a study.

The in situ footprints have the advantage of not being part of a temporary working quarry exposure, but are seasonally covered by a thick protective layer of sand. They are usually exposed throughout the late Autumn to late Spring. The site is easily accessible and is often used by local enthusiasts and those involved in tourism and education. The accessibility makes the track site a tourist attraction as well as a research resource for visitors to the north of the Isle of Skye.

International Value: Dinosaur remains of the Middle Jurassic are rare worldwide. Large dinosaur footprints are known from the Middle Jurassic of England, Portugal and the United States. The footprints from the Duntulm Formation at An Corran provide evidence for large theropod dinosaurs with tracks of over 50cm in length making them amongst some of the largest theropod dinosaur footprints of this age. Tracks of similarly large theropods are now also known from temporary exposures in a landfill quarry in Oxfordshire and from the Cleveland basin of Yorkshire. Research links with Wyoming, USA, will allow comparative studies to be undertaken and it has been proposed that the An Corran site be part of a geological twinning exercise with dinosaur localities near Shell, Wyoming because of the similarity in age and footprint type.",Jurassic,"FM,EC",

The trackways yield data relevant to our understanding of saurian locomotion, the taphonomy and systematic taxonomy of the footprints, the systematics of the taxa thought to be represented, the taxonomic composition of this particular ecosystem, and the ethology of these animals.
Evidence of gait transition associated with a temporary increase in speed on a theropod trackway has important implications for understanding the biomechanics and evolution of basal theropods.  The interpretation of many sauropod tracks as having been formed by members of the Titanosaura pushes the origins of this group back into the Middle Jurassic and provides evidence that counters theories wherein titanosaurs originated in Gondwana after the berak-up of Pangea during the late Middle Jurassic.  The similar directions of the trackways combined with the relatively limited time period over which the tracks could have been made may suggest that the sauropods were moving in a mixed herd.

Although the esker is relatively small (c. 5km long) and isolated compared to other GCR esker systems in Scotland, it has a high conservation value because of its isolated upland location, its association with subglacial meltwater channels of the same age and its relatively intact state. Unlike the large, complex esker systems at Carstairs and Kildrummie, which accumulated during the more advanced stages of glacier melting in valley bottoms, the Bedshiel Kaims document the early stages of englacial and subglacial meltwater drainage associated with an ice stream draining the Scottish sector of the Dimlington Stadial ice sheet. Moreover, the spatial continuum of nearby meltwater channels and the esker provides clear evidence of waning discharge and sediment carrying capacity due to changes in subglacial bed slope. The site has potential for further research on the patterns and evolution of subglacial meltwater drainage.

These unusual geomorphological features provide valuable information concerning the nature of climatic and environmental conditions in Wales towards the end of the last ice-sheet glaciation. The landforms comprise a series of peat-filled, crater-like basins surrounded by better-drained, grassy ramparts. The detailed form and nature of the features at Llanpumsaint have been studied from borehole and trench sections and by using various geophysical and sedimentological techniques. The features are interpreted provisionally as the remains of lithalsas (mineral palsas) and open-system pingos developed in a tundra-like terrain. It is proposed that ice masses, some possibly fed by underground springs in a permafrost environment, heaved the ground surface into large mounds which collapsed when the ice masses melted. This process left prominent, probably water-filled, depressions which became partly infilled with sediment and peat in late- and post-glacial times. In a comprehensive Wales-wide study of visually comparable landforms, the features at Llanpumsaint are regarded as the best-preserved examples in Wales, together with the classic and much-studied features at Nant Cledlyn. Their respective modes of formation may, however, not be the same. The features at Llanpumsaint are also exceptional on a Great Britain scale, rivalling the form, density and outstanding state of preservation of classic features at East Walton Common, Cambridgeshire. They have significant potential for further research.

	Llanpumsaint is a critical component of  GCR sites representing the Quaternary Period in Wales. The selected sites cover all major aspects of the Quaternary history and geomorphology of Wales. The sites include major glacial erosional and depositional landform complexes (e.g. Snowdon, Cadair Idris, Brecon Beacons), stratigraphical sections (e.g. Bacon Hole and Minchin Hole caves), individual glacial landforms (e.g. moraines and glacial meltwater channels), late- and post-glacial biostratigraphical sites (e.g. Traeth Mawr) and tufa deposits (e.g. Cwm Nash and Caerwys) among many others. There is also a critical network of sites representing periglacial conditions and landforms to which the Llanpumsaint site belongs. Llanpumsaint complements the Cledlyn Valley GCR site already selected for what were believed to be ramparted ground-ice depressions. Recent research, however, may suggest that although the landforms at Llanpumsaint and Cledlyn Valley have some visual and morphological similarities, they may have been formed by different processes. The close spacing of the Llanpumsaint landforms is similar to active lithalsas from the current permafrost zone and some of the Llanpumsaint features are akin to open-system pingos fed by groundwater seepage through faults. The Llanpumsaint features are developed entirely within glaciolacustrine sediments, and the presence of deformation structures in the ramparts is thought to be the result of periglacial processes; a supraglacial or subglacial origin has therefore been ruled out. In contrast, the ramparted depressions at Cledlyn Valley GCR site are frequently linear in form and comprise till which shows no obvious sign of periglacial disturbance. Recent preliminary work suggests that the Cledlyn ramparts may be till ridges formed through the stagnation and melting of glacier ice. Collectively, the Llanpumsaint and Cledlyn sites may prove critical in distinguishing between ramparted depressions formed by periglacial processes and morphologically similar features formed by subglacial processes. (Ross et al., 2006).

Graptolites are characteristic of the Wenlock sequence, ranging from the Cyrtograptus lundgreni Biozone to the Monograptus ludensis Biozone, and facilitate correlation with areas farther afield in central and eastern Europe.

The deposit consists of a thick layer of now diagenetically altered spherules of molten rock, ejected during the early cratering process.  This is coupled with various pressure shocked and polymorphic mineral phases from the ejecta curtain and ejecta plume, and later dust from atmospheric re-entry of ejected material.  The layer has been dated and magnetostratigraphy has been conducted on the sequence.  The layer is stratified and some density adjustment has occurred, howeevr there is a strong case for the gross depositional history to be relatively intact.  A lot of the mineral phases in the deopsit are unusual and rare as they have endured, or are the result of, the cratering process.
Aside from the highest refractory minerals, the cratering-process phase changes vast amounts of rock into liquid or plasma.  This material can be homogenous locally but variable in relation to the sum of the ejecta, and most is a mix of elements dictated by the original constituents and the pathway to deposition.  This indiscriminate mixing and later diagenetic stabilisation can result in very complex ploygenetic and polyshematic grains, many of which await reporting in detail.
IN addition to the incredible rarity of an intact ejecta layer, almost uniquely, the source crater has been reliably identified, based upon dating to establish the event's timing at 214 Ma (+/- 1) with source correlation of biotite ages, coupled with zircon and garnet studies.

With the exception of a number of thin marine units, the bulk of the Ravenscar Group consists of mudrocks and sandstones considered to have been deposited in a coastal plain complex that may have comprised of flood plains, shallow lakes and marshes, as well as abandoned river channels.  The sandstone units are considered to have been deposited within river channels or as levee and crevasse splay deposits.  Palaeosols containing rootlet horizons and/or sideritic concretions attest to marshy conditions whilst the common and diverse plant remains indicate the presence of luxuriant vegetation.

The trackways are preserved as surface prints, underprints and transmitted prints.  Where the substrate was highly charged with fluid, de-watering triggered by the footfalls of the animals led to the convolution and deformation of the sediment.  This feature is commonly referred to as ‘dinoturbation’.  Thirty-one different track morphotypes have so far been recognized and are considered to represent at least 15 different ichnotaxa representing both bipedal and quadrupedal forms, of which 7 to 10 common types may belong to sauropods, stegosaurids, ornithopods and theropods.  Some morphotypes consist of raking prints representing swimming activities.

Estimates of the abundance of trackways in the Ravenscar Group are taken to indicate that the sequence represents a ‘megatracksite’ as these estimates are well in excess of the arbitrarily defined value of 1000 tracks or 100 trackways used to define a ‘megatracksite’.  The distribution of morphotypes varies through the succession.  For example, the ichnotaxon Deltopodus brodricki (thought to represent the prints of an early stegosaurian) is particularly abundant within the Saltwick Formation, although it occurs at lower abundances throughout much of the Ravenscar Group.  Raked prints providing evidence of swimming are also most abundant in the Saltwick Formation, and their relative paucity in the rest of the Ravenscar Group supports other evidence, suggesting that the climate became increasingly arid during this part of the Middle Jurassic.

The tracks and trackways of the Ravenscar Group have been studied fairly intensively over the past 19 years.  Situated on an eroding cliffed and rocky coastline, this site has the potential to reveal many new tracks and trackways, adding significantly to an understanding of the ecology of the dinosaurs represented by these ichnoassemblages, as well as better understanding the environmental conditions under which the Ravenscar Group was deposited.

Although trackways have been observed at some of the remaining sites and either the prints have been assigned to ichnotaxa, or attributed to specific organisms, the primary interest at such sites appears to be in the skeletal remains.

This behaviour is unusual compared with the Eriboll, Assynt and Achnashellach districts and shows that large displacements on thrusts are possible without necessarily developing imbricate zones in their footwalls.  The geology is strongly reflected by the scarp and dip-slope topography.",Precambrian,EO,

Near three-dimensional exposures of thrusts and related folds make this GCR site area ideal for appreciating the range and complexity of structural geometries that can result from repeated imbrication and ramp-flat thrust surfaces.  The individual fault surfaces are exposed in many localities.
	The regional Sole Thrust to the imbricate zone on Foinaven and Conamheall is generally difficult to identify because of the complexity of small-scale thrust surfaces.  On Foinaven itself, the sole must lie within the False-bedded Quartzite Member as this unit is found within the imbricate slices on Creag Urbhard.  However, the imbricate zone in general climbs up into the An t-Sron Formation as these rocks are found preserved in some thrust slices.  It is likely that the original roof to the imbricate zone lay for a few metres within the carbonate rocks of the Durness Group.  The nature of the present roof to the imbricate zone is variable but thrust relationships are clearly displayed on Creagan Meall Horn.  It is likely that the imbricate slices passed upwards into a thrust that carried isolated slices of Lewisian gneiss; presumably attached to the Moine Thrust Sheet.  However, in places the imbricate slices are truncated by later thrusts and in others the upper thrusts are folded by the imbricates.  Thus the simple sequential models of thrust development do not apply here and the geometries are better explained by synchronous thrusting.  These are new concepts for the Moine Thrust Belt, and for thrust systems in general, and it remains to be seen how widely they are applicable.
The area is superb for tracking the detailed lateral variation in imbricate structures and for examining the transition in fault-rock type across a broad swathe of the Moine Thrust Belt.  Yet it remains to be established how far the late motions at the base of the Moine Thrust Sheet can be traced.  The outcrop quality is ideal for investigating the distribution of cataclastic fault rocks, developed in the Pipe Rock, but to date there has been remarkably little work on these materials, in contrast to the ductile mylonites found elsewhere in the thrust belt.

The outcrops are clean and readily accessible, making them admirably suited for study, unlike some other parts of the Moine Thrust Belt.  Further, there is an excellent array of outcrops that show the progressive retrogression and shearing of Lewisianoid gneisses related to the thrusting.  The kinematic indicators in the high-strain ‘Oystershell Rock’ are particularly clear and imply a consistent WNW-directed emplacement direction.
	The site also contains exceptional exposures of post-Caledonian (probably Devonian) normal faults with spectacular carbonate-rich fault rocks.  These show complex cyclic histories of brecciation and cementation that are characteristic of seismogenic faults.  This is also one of the very few places where Caledonian thrusts are clearly cut by post-Caledonian normal faults with the overprinting of the earlier mylonites by later cataclasites clearly demonstrated.

Although stilpnomelane occurs sporadically elsewhere in the Scottish Dalradian, it is particularly easy to find here as it is relatively abundant and the crystals are up to 1 mm in size, which is quite large for stilpnomelane.  There is little published on the mineral, and although the crystal structure is well known, its crystal chemistry and thermodynamic properties are not well understood.  For this reason it is important to preserve a site where fresh, relatively large grains are preserved in a host rock that has not been significantly retrogressed.  Here its growth is reasonably well constrained with respect to the regional deformation and metamorphism, and the host-rock mineral assemblage can be used theoretically to quantify the temperature and pressure of metamorphism under which this particular stilpnomelane formed.  An important constraint on the formation of stilpnomelane is the chemical composition of the host rock, which can be reliably established at this site as the rock is relatively fresh. 
This small site also exhibits good examples of sedimentary structures such as cross-bedding, dewatering structures and scours, which are found within the Laphroaig Quartzite.

It occurs in a sill that also has a 1 m-thick layer of meta-anorthosite, representing an original plagioclase-rich layer.  The sill, therefore, is an excellent example of a layered basic igneous intrusion that has been metamorphosed to the greenschist facies.

The importance of the Ardscalpsie Point GCR site lies in the fact that it is probably the best place for studying in detail this limb of the structure, to check whether the field relationships accord with the proposed structural model for the nappe (for details of the evolution of the Tay Nappe.  
	At this site, the Dalradian rocks belong to the Bullrock Greywacke, a thick unit of pebbly metagreywackes and thin bands of slaty metamudstone, which was deposited from turbidity flows in a submarine fan environment.  It is amongst the youngest of the Dalradian formations, and occupies a position close to the top of the Southern Highland Group. Sedimentary structures, especially graded bedding, and bedding-cleavage relationships can be very clearly seen in these rocks on the 400 m-long coastal section adjacent to Ardscalpsie Point.  The combination of undoubted, and plentiful, way-up evidence, with structural data, provides a very clear demonstration that the Bullrock Greywacke lies on the upper limb of a major F1 fold, the ‘Tay Nappe’, that closes downwards and yet has the older rocks in its core.  It is a downward-facing, or synformal, anticline, as envisaged by Shackleton (1958), from preliminary observations at Ardscalpsie.  This fold, originally flat-lying, was rotated into its present position by folding on the Highland Border Downbend.  
In addition, this GCR site is also excellent for studying the development of spaced cleavage in quartz-rich metasedimentary rocks, and one of the few places where a branch of the Highland Boundary Fault, the major fault bounding the Dalradian outcrop on its south-east side, is fully exposed.

Some have a dark ‘cross’ due to inclusions of graphite and their overall appearance is characteristic of chiastolite (a variety of the aluminium silicate, andalusite).  However, thin sections reveal that the original andalusite has been replaced by kyanite, identical in composition to andalusite but stable under higher pressure conditions.  These are exceptionally clear examples of a feature that has great significance in the understanding of metamorphic terranes and hence could be said to have some international importance.
Detailed mineralogical studies have enabled the temperature and pressure at the peak of metamorphism to be calculated and, when combined with similar determinations throughout the region, these data reveal significant differences in metamorphic history between rocks on either side of the N–S-trending Portsoy Lineament.  It has been suggested that this is due to a considerable thickness of low-pressure–high-temperature rocks from the Buchan Block in the east having been overthrust westwards, increasing the overburden pressure on the rocks below and hence causing the low-pressure andalusite to recrystallize as the high-pressure form of aluminium silicate, kyanite.",Precambrian,"EW,EO",

The mineralization occurs within the Ben Challum Quartzite Formation, a unit restricted to the Tyndrum area, which is important scientifically because of the insight it provides into the depositional settings of Argyll Group sediments.  There is clear evidence that faults were active during deposition, that they acted as conduits for mineralizing fluids, and that they created the topography necessary to pond the fluids once they had been exhaled onto the seabed.  Contemporaneous magmatic activity provided the source of heat required to circulate the fluids through crustal rocks beneath the seafloor, where they were able to gather base metals such as copper and zinc. The chemistry and geometry of the mineralized units, combined with the mineralogy of their host sediments, suggest an island-arc-related tectonic setting.

The migmatization was a result of partial melting of the rocks during the local D3 phase of deformation, which occurred shortly after the regional metamorphism had reached its peak in the upper amphibolite facies.  This deformation was contemporaneous with the intrusion of basic magma (the Tarland Intrusion), which may have increased the heat flux sufficiently to cause a local increase in the proportion of partial melt.
A striking feature of the gneisses is the presence of large prismatic crystals of sillimanite that formed during the peak of metamorphism.  Later metamorphism at lower pressure resulted in the growth of andalusite, and the well-preserved mineral assemblages from this GCR site have contributed significantly to a study of variations in temperature and pressure during metamorphism in this part of the Grampian Highlands.

Its radiometric age has been the subject of numerous investigations, initially to establish a minimum age for the Dalradian succession, and increasingly as a means of dating the early phases of Caledonian deformation.  Ongoing field-based investigations are focussed upon determining when the granite was emplaced relative to the four phases of deformation seen in the country rocks, and whether there is evidence for more than one orogenic event having affected the Dalradian rocks.  
The granite magma was intruded as a sheet-like body into a sequence of limestones, mudrocks, and quartzose sands belonging to the Appin Group.  The heat that was released transformed the adjoining sedimentary rocks into a baked rock, or hornfels, of which only a small area remains and is currently exposed at ground level.  Because of having been heated to c. 600°C, and losing much of their fluid during this process, the hornfelsed rocks became resistant to later deformation and hence much of their early history has been preserved intact.  Their most significant feature is that minerals such as cordierite and andalusite, which grew in response to the heat, preserve a weak tectonic fabric within them.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to be absolutely certain whether this fabric formed due to the forceful emplacement of the granite, or during an earlier, pre-Caledonian deformation event.  However, it is clear that the granite was emplaced before the first deformation (D1) to affect the Dalradian Supergroup.  Fragments of the country rock which were torn off and encapsulated in the magma when it was emplaced, preserve significant evidence of the non-folded state of the rocks at that time.  
	From a study of the mineralogy of the hornfels it has been concluded that the granite stopped rising and had crystallized fully at an estimated depth of 7–14 km beneath the surface of the Earth.  The granite and enclosing country rocks were then strongly deformed, metamorphosed, and recrystallized, during the main progressive deformation (D2) and associated climax of regional metamorphism of the Grampian Event at about 470 million years ago.  This process had a dramatic effect upon the mineralogy of the hornfels, as the low- to medium- pressure cordierite and andalusite were replaced by new high-pressure minerals such as kyanite and garnet that reflect the  greatly increased depth of burial reached during the orogeny.
	Geochemical and isotopic analyses of the Ben Vuirich Granite show that it has the chemical fingerprint characteristic of granites found in rifted portions of the Earth’s crust.  This finding supports an earlier hypothesis that the granite formed in the same extensional tectonic setting that enabled the extrusion of the 600 Ma Tayvallich Lavas to take place (see West Tayvallich Peninsula GCR site).  The granite was possibly derived from partial melting of the Dalradian sedimentary rocks, or their basement, and belongs to a swarm of rift-related granitoids that originally stretched along the Caledonian orogenic belt from the Appalachians to Scotland, and heralded the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia.

The site also contains possibly unique exposures of the hinge of a later major fold, the Highland Border Downbend, which was responsible for the rotation of the original flat-lying rocks, exemplified in the Rotmell GCR site, into the steep-dipping downward-facing attitude, seen in the Little Glen Shee GCR site.",Precambrian,EO,

It is largely metavolcanic in origin and comprises sub-marine lavas and various volcaniclastic rocks, interbedded with minor metasedimentary lithologies of deep-water facies.  The volcanic succession has been intruded by comagmatic hornblende gabbro and by albite felsite (‘sodic keratophyre’) of unknown affinity.  All of the rocks have been deformed and metamorphosed, up to middle amphibolite facies in places; some of the finer grained rocks have a phyllitic texture.
The metavolcanic rocks include basaltic pillow lavas and brecciated ultramafic rocks that are interpreted as high-magnesium lavas.  Clasts within the latter have spectacular and highly distinctive elongate pseudomorphs after crystals of olivine, which have been likened to the spinifex texture characteristic of unusual high-temperature lavas known as komatiites.  Unfortunately later serpentinization has obliterated details of the texture and its origin has been the subject of debate, but the presence of komatiites in post-Archaean rocks is rather unusual, and the possibility of their presence in Shetland is highly significant and of international interest.
The rock assemblage illustrates the final phase in the development of the Dalradian extensional basin in the Shetland area.  An abrupt increase in the rate and depth of extensional faulting is considered to have caused generation of the highly unusual ultramafic lavas, followed by eruption of more-typical, within-plate basaltic lavas.  A considerable thickness of the basaltic lavas and associated volcaniclastic rocks built up as the basin filled; since many of the lavas are pillowed, sub-marine eruption is confirmed.  The volcanic sequence can be traced offshore by geophysical methods as far north as the island of Unst, and it might have formed the floor of an intracontinental basin on the edge of Laurentia from which the Shetland Ophiolite was obducted.  Hence, the geological features preserved within the Cunningsburgh GCR site have profound implications for the wider interpretation of the Dalradian succession both in Shetland and in the Scottish mainland.",Precambrian,"EC,EO",

It was here in 1893 that George Barrow first erected a scheme of metamorphic zones based upon the first appearance of various index minerals with increasing metamorphic grade in pelitic rocks.  These zones are typical of regional metamorphism at moderate to high pressures within the greenschist and amphibolite facies and have subsequently been recognized throughout the world.  The GCR site provides, within a short distance, examples of Dalradian pelitic rocks from all of the Barrovian metamorphic zones, which are characterized, with increasing grade, by chlorite, biotite, garnet, staurolite, kyanite and sillimanite.
	The exposures are all readily accessible, and are invaluable for teaching purposes.  Only the garnet zone exposure is of less than excellent quality, and even it is acceptable.  The index minerals can mostly be seen with the naked eye, and all are conspicuous under a hand lens.  The exposures can also be used to demonstrate the development of folds and cleavages during successive deformation and progressive coarsening of texture within rocks of increasing grade.
Thin sections from these rocks have enabled the timing of growth of the various minerals to be worked out with respect to the four regional deformations that affected Dalradian rocks of the eastern Grampian Highlands.  Further work could involve electron-microprobe analysis of co-existing mineral phases to work out the temperature and pressure during deformation in different parts of the site.

By careful observation of bedding and cleavage orientations combined with sedimentological way-up evidence, it is possible to recognize an early near-isoclinal syncline-anticline fold pair whose axial plane originally dipped gently to the south-east.  These NW-verging folds have been refolded by more-obvious tight upright folds, giving rise to a large-scale interference structure that is transected by the Kymah Burn.
	The site is representative of three major formations and is a type section for one.  The Ladder Hills Formation is a sequence of turbiditic psammites, semipelites and pelites over a kilometre thick that formed in a small local basin coeval with the deposition of tillites and related glacial deposits over a wider area of Scotland and Ireland.  It includes minor metabasalt units with pillow structures, altered mafic volcaniclastic units and thin lenticular metadolostone beds.  Laterally it passes south-eastwards into the Nochty Semipelite and Limestone Formation.  Both formations are overlain by the Kymah Quartzite Formation, marked by the incoming of thicker purer sands, typically showing cross bedding and gritty bases to the beds.  Basaltic lava and possible tuffaceous units are also recognized in this formation.  Metadolerite sheets and rare dykes have also intruded the whole sequence during the Caledonian Orogeny.  Although the beds have been metamorphosed to amphibolite facies, later retrogression has partly altered the original peak metamorphic mineral assemblages to greenschist facies.
	The site is of national importance as it documents some unique stratigraphical variations in the Islay subgroup, displays good evidence of mafic volcanism coeval with the widespread mid-Dalradian glaciation, and provides a valuable insight into the overall structure of this part of the North-east Grampian Highlands.",Precambrian,EW,

The detailed evidence indicates that the original sediments were deposited within continental alluvial and fluvial environments.

Transitional contacts between the major rock units, coupled with sedimentary repetition of distinctive lithologies, precludes the presence of a major, orogenic, unconformity at this stratigraphical level.  This finding is supported by a microscope study of rocks from this GCR site, which has confirmed the field-based conclusion that both groups have been affected by the same number of structural events, having the same intensity of development, and geometry.	Thus a boundary that was formerly taken to be the contact between the Moine and Dalradian supergroups can now be confidently recognized as a normal stratigraphical contact between the two lowest groups of the Dalradian succession.  This conclusion is supported by observations at the River Leven Section and Strath Fionan GCR sites.

This fold, the Tay Nappe, is one of the largest and most significant major structures in the whole of the Grampian Terrane, and indeed in the whole of Great Britain.  The sites also show typical examples of the primary sedimentary and subsequent metamorphic characteristics of the rocks that comprise the Southern Highland Group.
Relative to the other two GCR sites in this area, the rocks of the Little Glen Shee site originated at the highest level in the Tay Nappe and are at the lowest metamorphic grade.  They display exceptionally well-preserved sedimentary structures, especially the graded bedding that results from the rapid deposition of coarse sands in a turbiditic deep water environment.  They also display unusually clear examples of the first generation of folds, together with their steeply dipping axial-planar cleavage, which in the coarser grained rocks takes the form of a widely spaced pressure-solution cleavage.  The bedding/cleavage relationships, together with the sedimentary structures, show quite dramatically at this site that the folds are totally inverted; this was the classic area where Shackleton (1958) first developed the concept of structural ‘facing’, now an internationally accepted term.  These folds are thus ‘downward-facing’, the explanation for which requires examination of the Craig a’Barns GCR site.  
	The rocks of the Craig a’Barns GCR site once occupied deeper levels of the Tay Nappe than those of the Little Glen Shee site.  Consequently, the original sedimentary bedding characteristics, and the small-scale folds and cleavages that formed during the initial stage of nappe formation, have all been considerably modified by a second generation of small-scale structures, both folds and cleavage, which relate to subsequent development of the nappe.  The site also contains possibly unique exposures of the hinge of a later major fold, the Highland Border Downbend, which was responsible for the rotation of the original flat-lying rocks, exemplified in the Rotmell GCR site, into the steep-dipping downward-facing attitude, seen in the Little Glen Shee GCR site.  
	At the Rotmell GCR site it can be clearly seen that the cleavage related to the first generation structures, as seen at the Little Glen Shee GCR site, has been strongly modified by a second deformation.  It has been suggested that the second generation of small-scale structures, both folds and cleavage, are a result of the transport and emplacement of the Tay Nappe.  Originally upward-facing first structures are believed to have been translated many kilometres to the south-east, and modified by the second deformation, so that much of the Southern Highland Group, such as that in the Rotmell GCR site, lies in the inverted limb of the resulting sideways-facing fold.  Rocks in the Rotmell GCR site contain crystals of garnet, which are evidence of relatively deep burial, but rocks originally at a higher level in the nappe and subsequently bent down, such as those now exposed at the Little Glen Shee GCR site, exhibit a much lower grade of metamorphism.",Precambrian,EO,

The complex patterns of deformation and metamorphism, which are more usually encountered in the Northern Grampian Highlands, are less well developed here and hence the lithologies can be analysed using sedimentological techniques that are more readily applied to undeformed Phanerozoic successions.  
	A common vertical sequence of sedimentary structures is well preserved.  This sequence is comparable with that of Bouma (1962) used for the analysis of turbidites and consists of a basal massive division (Ta) overlain in turn by a lower planar laminated division (Tb), a cross-laminated division (Tc), an upper planar laminated division (Td) and is capped by semipelite (mud, Te).  Additionally the preservation of rip-up clasts, scours and the sharp-based nature of the beds indicate that these turbiity currents were very high density, as would be expected in a channelized system.

At the GCR site, this gneissose zone is developed within a sequence of semipelitic to psammitic metasedimentary rocks forming part of the Colla Firth Formation in the Whiteness Group of the Shetland Dalradian.  The psammites and pelites have been recrystallized to a homogeneous granoblastic gneiss with a fabric parallel to that in the adjacent rocks outside the belt, which have been regionally metamorphosed and deformed but are not gneissose.  Numerous granitic sheets and veins were intruded into both the gneiss belt and the adjacent non-gneissose rocks and these too have a schistose fabric.  
	Textural evidence preserved within the rocks of this GCR site confirms that the regional metamorphism and gneiss formation, although possibly originating from distinct events, were both broadly coincident with the principal deformation and that all of these events only shortly preceded or overlapped with the intrusion of granitic sheets.  The age of the granitic sheets is therefore of great national importance as an indicator of the minimum age of deformation and peak metamorphism in the Shetland Dalradian.  A radiometric, Rb-Sr date of 530 ± 25 Ma is imprecise, probably inaccurate and dating by a modern, more-precise method is clearly desirable.  However, the date does suggest that the deformation might be radically different in timing to the deformation affecting the Dalradian sequence elsewhere (e.g.  peaking at c. 470 Ma in the Grampian Highlands).  It follows that an understanding of these tectonometamorphic relationships is crucial for the wider interpretation of the Dalradian succession both in Shetland and in the Scottish mainland.",,EC,

Unusually, small-scale folds of the first generation (D1) can also be identified, clearly pre-dating those of the second generation.  The second-generation folds themselves have small-scale structures of a still later generation (the regional D4 phase) superimposed upon them.  Thus the small-scale structures can be used not only to establish the sequence of deformation events but also to identify the relative age of a major fold.

This is the type locality in the UK for the High Rock Platform, here emerged to an elevation of about 33 m OD.  The High Rock Platform is mantled with till and marine deposits, demonstrating that the platform pre-dates at least one period of glaciation and a later period of high sea level.  The regional tilt of the Main Rock Platform, which can be traced throughout much of the Inner Hebrides, reflects the relative rates of isostatic recovery in western Scotland following deglaciation.  The highly uneven platform is considered to have been produced by periglacial shore processes during the severe cold conditions of the Loch Lomond Stadial, some 11000-10000 years BP. The glaciated and regionally horizontal Low Rock Platform pre-dates the formation of the Main Rock Platfrom and has been interpreted as pre- or inter-glacial in origin.  Since all the platforms appear to be emerged features, the co-location of the lower two at present-day sea level stronly indicates that they are not not Holocene or modern features but are older, inherited from former sea levels, and subject to Holocene and modern re-trimming.    Notwithstanding the contrasting interpretations that surround the origin and age of these emerged marine features, the complete assemblage or well-preserved marine and glacial features is of outstanding scientific importance.
